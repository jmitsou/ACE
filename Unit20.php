						<legend><b>OBJECTIVES</b></legend>
						
						<li>To gain awareness of the legal repercussions of unpaid debt.</li>
						<li>To understand why secured credit is a priority to pay back.</li>
						<li>To understand the processes of foreclosure, eviction and repossession.</li>
						<li>To explore what clients can do to avoid negative, sometimes devastating, outcomes.</li>
						
						<p>Whenever a consumer has delinquent debts, it is important to decide which accounts are essential to pay and which are not as critical to resolve. This can be done only by understanding the consequences of each type of debt delinquency. Should a bank or creditor take legal action against a client, you must advise the client to seek legal representation. However, there are steps that can be taken to avoid worst-case scenarios.</p>
											
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>SECURED OR UNSECURED?</b></legend>

						<p>Is the outstanding debt secured or unsecured? This should be the first question when prioritizing a payment schedule. We remember that secured credit is a loan backed by collateral. Collateral is property (real or otherwise) that can be seized in the event of a debt delinquency.</p>
						
						<p>Common examples of secured credit are home mortgages and automobile loans. Should mortgage payments fall behind, the lender can seize your home (foreclosure). Should car payments lapse, the bank can literally drive your car away (repossession). Credit card companies that enlist collection agencies to harass for immediate payments should not deter you from settling secured debts first.</p>
						
						<p>Lenders of unsecured credit do not have the legal powers that lenders of secured credit have. This is because lenders of unsecured credit must first seek and win a court judgment before money or property can be seized. Generally speaking, threats to sue for monies owed are often never carried out because litigation is a costly and time-consuming process. Therefore, decide which debts are secured and pay them first!</p>
										
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>Victory Over Fear</b></legend>
						
						<p>Clients may express fear and uncertainty in light of frightening notices from collection agencies or court orders from lenders or attorneys. Fears can be diminished through knowledge. What can lenders really do? What can’t they do? When and how should a client negotiate with creditors? What can be done to avoid the damaging repercussions of outstanding debt?</p>
											
						<p>What follows are brief descriptions of what can happen when debts are not paid. They include foreclosure, eviction, repossession, utility shut-offs, and judgment liens that can result in bank account seizure, garnishment of wages, as well as other types of liens.</p>
							
						<p>As a counselor, you will want to know how your client can avoid the worst from happening. There are also tactics listed for getting payment amounts decreased should the client be unable to keep essential debts current.</p>
						
						<p>Contrary to popular myth, you will not go to jail for unpaid bills (with the exception of non-payment of child support). You can, however, be imprisoned for committing fraud. When negotiating with lenders or their attorneys, it is imperative that you are forthcoming and honest with all information you may furnish them.</p>
								
					</fieldset>    
					    
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>FORECLOSURE</b></legend>
						
						<p>This is a homeowner’s worst nightmare. Typically, if you have missed one or two mortgage payments, the lender will contact you by letter and telephone asking for the outstanding balance plus any late fees. These can be 5% – 6% of the monthly payment. After 60 to 90 days, if you do not pay or make contact with the lender, you will receive a formal notice in the mail. This is called the <b>Notice of Default.</b> It is the first step in the foreclosure process. At this point, you have 90 days to curethe debt by making up all your missed payments plus late charges. This will re-instate your loan and stop a foreclosure from proceeding.</p>
											
						<p>If you still do not pay or contact the lender in the allotted amount of time, another formal notice will arrive in the mail — the <b>Notice of Acceleration</b>. Literally, what you owe the lender is accelerated so that the full amount of the mortgage is due immediately to avoid a foreclosure sale.</p>
							
						<p>In some states, a court order is required before the lender can move to actually foreclose on your property. This will come delivered in the form of a summons at which time you will have the opportunity to respond and raise a defense. If you do not respond, a judgment to foreclose will proceed and the <b>Notice of Sale</b> is sent to your house. It gives the time and date that the foreclosure will take place.</p>
						
						<p>Foreclosure can take anywhere from 6 to 18 months to complete depending on how fast the lender moves, individual state laws and the circumstances and actions of the homeowner.</p>
		
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>AVOIDING FORECLOSURE</b></legend>
						
						<p>Avoiding foreclosure means keeping your mortgage payments current and paying property taxes and insurance on time. If a client is behind on his/her mortgage or even if he/she has already received a Notice of Default, there are strategies and options available for either reducing monthly payments or deferring certain expenses.</p>
											
						<p>Up until the date of foreclosure sale, consumers have certain rights as homeowners including the right to sell. The question is: Can the homeowner realistically keep up with the mortgage payments or is the financial setback only temporary? If it’s temporary, a workout may be the answer. If paying the monthly mortgage bill is simply not feasible given income versus expenses, then the house should be sold before a foreclosure sale ends the current homeowner’s right to do so.</p>
												
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>Mortgage Workouts</b></legend>
						
						<p>If a client is having trouble paying the mortgage, he/she can negotiate for an easier payment schedule either temporarily or permanently with the lender. This is known as a mortgage workout. Recently, banks and mortgage companies have become more willing to negotiate workouts with consumers to avoid the cost and time associated with foreclosure. Remember, a foreclosure can be a long, complicated process requiring documentation, correspondence and, in some states, court hearings. A workout can avoid all that. A common workout is an arrangement to cure a default by adding a percentage of the outstanding debt, known as the arrears, to the regular monthly payments until the debt becomes current.</p>
											
						<p>Another option is recasting the outstanding debt. If the homeowner is able to make the monthly mortgage payments, but cannot make up any past due installments, the arrears can be deferred or recastso that it is no longer a present obligation. It is recast as payment due at the end of the loan term.</p>
							
						<p>Consumers may also ask for a temporary (or in some cases permanent) interest rate reduction. They can even request a temporary moratorium on mortgage payments depending on the situation. Late fees and other penalties are commonly waived as long as the consumer communicates a sincere wish to resolve his/her debt. Workouts are no longer limited to one year. Today, arrangements lasting up to 36 months are common.</p>	 
							
						<p>Once the lender accelerates the loan and the full amount of the mortgage is due, options diminish. Few people have the money necessary to satisfy a Notice of Acceleration. Often, a second loan is procured to pay off the first one. This may delay foreclosure, but it makes little sense. Generally, the terms of the second loan will be even more difficult to satisfy than the first one. A better plan is to sell a property that has become unaffordable.</p>

					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>EVICTION</b></legend>
						
						<p>Being evicted from an apartment is, at the very least, disruptive. It can also be dangerous given that it can mean becoming homeless should the renter have no alternative place to live. When the rent is due and not paid, the landlord has the right to force the renter out through the eviction process. Just how this is accomplished varies considerably depending on state and city laws. For example, in New York, California, and Massachusetts, an eviction can take as long as a couple of months whereas in states that provide less consumer protections, a landlord could evict in a matter of two weeks.</p>
											
						<p>The first step in the eviction process is when the renter receives the <b>Notice to Quit</b> — sometimes called the <b>Notice to Vacate</b> — from the landlord. Basically, it tells the renter to pay up or vacate the premises within a very short amount of time. It is not a court order but a warning which gives renters the right to stay put if they pay the amount owed in back-rent (cure the debt).</p>
							
						<p>After the time allotted on the Notice to Quit has expired and the renter has not paid the debt, the landlord can file an eviction action in court. In some states, a landlord can file an action in court without the benefit of a formal warning. A hearing is then scheduled and the renter will receive a summons to appear in court.</p>	
						
						<p>If the renter does not attend the hearing, the landlord gets a default judgment against him/her. The landlord then takes it to the sheriff whose job it is to enforce the eviction. Some states require a week’s notice before the renters are forced out. Often the actual eviction takes longer depending on the sheriff’s schedule. If the renter is not out by the date of eviction, his/her belongings can be removed and put on the street.</p>
						
						<p>Ignoring the eviction process is disastrous. When people are forced to move against their will, they are, in effect, refugees. Their circumstances are turned upside down. Their expenses will actually increase as they scramble to find shelter, storage, parking for a vehicle, and food. Also, the landlord, like any extender of credit, has the right to sue for all unpaid back-rent.</p>
						
						<p>If the renter signed a lease, he/she is also legally bound to pay for all future months until the end of the lease period.</p>
							
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>AVOIDING EVICTION</b></legend>
											
						<p>This frightening scenario illustrates the absolute necessity for paying rent on time. If a client is having trouble coming up with the money due to a temporary financial setback, have him/her contact the landlord and explain the situation. The landlord may agree to a temporary rent reduction. Another option is to negotiate for the acceptance of weekly rent payments until the renter is caught up. If moving out is inevitable, have renters do so on their own terms. Ask for reduced rent payment in exchange for voluntarily moving by a certain date.</p>

						<p>Of course, the landlord has no obligation to agree to anything. He/she may wish to avoid the eviction process, but that depends on the desirability of the rental property and his/her rapport with the renter.</p>
							
						<p><b>Renter’s Rights</b><br />Whether or not a renter has a defense, he/she should attend the eviction hearing to make sure that the amount of back-rent the landlord is suing for is correct. Also, that is a good time to present mitigating circumstances such as an illness or job loss to get an extension before the eviction takes effect.</p>
							
						<p>Landlords cannot seize personal property without a court order or lock tenants out of their home. If these actions take place, renters have the right to countersue. Also, landlords cannot evict in retaliation for reporting substandard housing conditions. If a tenant becomes involved in any of these circumstances, they should get legal representation.</p>
									
					</fieldset>
					 
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>AUTOMOBILE REPOSSESSION</b></legend>
						
						<p>Theoretically, a default occurs as soon as one payment of any installment loan is missed. The lender then has the right to seize whatever property was guaranteed as collateral. In the case of automobile loans, the lender can put a lien on the car and sell it to recoup some of the money owed. Some states require the lender to send a Notice of Default giving the car owner the opportunity to cure the loan. However, in a state without this requirement, people may not even know they are in default!</p>
											
						<p>Therefore, it is essential to keep track of secured loan payments. If it is uncertain whether a car is subject to repossession, check the lender’s contract to see if the vehicle is listed under security. Also, check the certificate of title to see who is listed as owner. If the lender is listed as owner, then the consumer is leasing the car — so it is subject to repossession anytime the loan is in default.</p>
						
						<p>Henchmen with crowbars coming to take your automobile is a myth. The “repo man”cannot take a car by force. Any breach of the peace is illegal and a person has the right to sue should this occur. Still, the car can be taken at any time, opened with a duplicate key and even hot-wired.</p>
						
						<p>Cars can be taken from open garages and, in some states, unlocked closed garages. When a person is in default of the automobile loan, he/she is probably under surveillance. The lender provides the “repo” man (or woman) with personal information about a person’s whereabouts, workplace, address, school schedule, or anywhere he/she habitually drives to and leaves the car unattended. Cars are then most often driven away quietly.</p>
						
						<p>Getting a repossessed automobile back is expensive and, in some cases, difficult. In a specified, short amount of time, it may be possible to re-instate the loan under its original conditions by paying the amount owed, plus late fees, plus the expense the lender paid to repossess and store the vehicle. This could amount to several hundred dollars more than what was owed at first default.</p>
						
						<p>The lender has the right to reject attempts to re-instate the loan if the car has been repossessed in the past or there is fraudulent information on the credit application. Also, if there was an attempt to hide your vehicle from the possibility of repossession or if the re-possessor was assaulted, reinstatement likely will be denied.</p>
						
						<p>The <b class="teal-text">Deficiency Balance</b>.  Relinquishing an automobile and letting the lender sell it does not end the trouble. Typically, repossessed cars are sold at private sales where used automobile dealers bid and purchase vehicles at drastically reduced prices. A car valued at $14,000 might go for as little as $6,000. After the sale, it’s up to the person who defaulted to make up the difference to the lender. This is known as the <b class="teal-text">deficiency balance</b>. For example, if $8,000 on the car loan is owed, but it sold for only $3,500, then the difference as well as the expenses incurred in the process of repossessing, storing and selling the former property is owed.</p>
			
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>OPTIONS</b></legend>
						
						<p>If a car is repossessed or if a notice of default has been received, contact the lender and request that the loan be reinstated long enough for the owner to sell the car on his/her own. Provided that the vehicle has been maintained properly and shows no damage, an independent sale will raise more money to pay back the lender than a repossession sale would.</p>
											
						<p>Lenders also have been known to waive the <b class="teal-text">deficiency balance</b> if there is obviously no way to pay and no assets to seize. However, the amount forgiven by a lender must be reported to the IRS as income.</p>
							
						<p>It is also possible to negotiate a workout with the lender, especially if the value of the car is less than the amount owed on the loan. Typically, the lender would agree not to seize the vehicle as long as reduced monthly payments were maintained.</p>	
							
						<p>The chosen option in the face of repossession should depend on the importance of the vehicle to a consumer’s everyday life, how much has been paid into it, and the risk of incurring a <b class="teal-text">deficiency balance</b>. Also, the client must realistically determine his/her ability to pay for and maintain the vehicle over the long haul.</p>	

					</fieldset>
					 
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>UTILITY SHUT-OFFS</b></legend>
						
						<p>Unlike credit-card companies and department stores that must resort to collection agencies to recoup unpaid debts, utility companies can discontinue essential services when bills are not paid on time. These service companies provide the modern conveniences that are actually indispensable for living comfortably and productively in today’s society.</p>
											
						<p>Any interruption of service whether it be water, heat, electricity or telephone presents an extreme disruption. Service termination also brings unforeseen expenses into the picture. For example, if the electricity is turned off, cooking and storing food is not an option. This means eating out for every meal. If the water is cut off, the home is virtually uninhabitable. Without a telephone, the link to the outside world is severed. Making calls would require a drive around the block and a bag full of change. Receiving calls would no longer be possible without standing by a pay phone for a good part of the day. Update: Pay phones are becoming a thing of the past!</p>
							
						<p>Publicly owned utility companies must, by law, send a notice stating that they will terminate service unless bills are paid. The customer is then given the opportunity to pay within a specified amount of time. Usually the threat of a shut-off is enough to convince the customer to pay all or a portion of the outstanding bill immediately. Privately owned companies may not be required to notify the customer and can simply cut service without warning.</p>
							
						<p>Getting the utility service turned back on after termination is not always easy. It usually requires full payment of back-bills plus late charges, plus a re-installment fee and, in some cases, a deposit. A customer may try and get the additional fees waived by convincing the utility company of a temporary financial setback that is now resolved. Also, customers may negotiate to pay their past-due bills in installments over a certain period of time. When a deposit is required, it is generally equivalent to the average of two monthly bills. A deposit requirement may be avoided by providing the signature of a co-signer who then becomes responsible for payment of defaulted bills.</p>	
												
					</fieldset>
										
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>REDUCING UTILITY BILLS</b></legend>
											
						<p>If a client has had problems in the past keeping up with utility payments, chances are those same problems will continue in the future unless monthly service bills are reduced. Here are some options available to the consumer when current utility bills become burdensome or simply unaffordable.</p>
							
						<p><b>Discount Plans.</b> Clients may qualify for reduced rates on their utility bills through public assistance. Many utility companies have programs available for low-income customers. Information about these plans can be obtained by contacting the utility company or your state public utility commission.</p>
						
						<p><b>Changing or Eliminating Unnecessary Services.</b> Some utilities are nonessential and should be voluntarily canceled during financially hard times. Some of these discretionary services include cable television, internet service, extra telephone lines, and cellular telephone service. Additionally, there are ways to customize bills for service contingent on specific usage. For example, telephone companies offer a variety of payment plans that reduce rates at certain times of the day or on weekends. The same is true for companies that provide electricity.</p>
						
						<p><b>Reducing Your Utility Usage.</b> There are several ways to cut utility bills through energy efficient light bulbs,low flowfaucets and winterization. Customers may be eligible for low-cost or even free conservation assistance. Again, check with the utility company or contact the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).</p>
							
						<p>Remember, effective problem solving depends on knowledge and the creative ability necessary to take steps to avoid negative contingencies. If you do have a client facing eviction or foreclosure or utility terminations, you will want to be able to provide reassurance and strategies to minimize financial setbacks.</p>
												
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>CONSUMER RIGHTS</b></legend>
						
						<p>Protections against termination of utility services as well as eligibility for government assistance varies depending on who your provider is. However, the general rules by which companies must adhere are as follows:</p>
											
						<li>Utility companies must provide notification of impending shut-off.</li>
						<li>Customers have a right to a hearing.</li>
						<li>Customers have a right to arrange for deferred payments.</li>
						<li>Customers are protected from shut-offs during winter months.</li>
						<li> The seriously ill are protected from service termination.</li>
						<li>Landlords cannot terminate service to their renters.</li>
							    					
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>LAWSUITS</b></legend>
		
						<p>When a consumer falls behind on payments to a lender of unsecured credit, the lender has the legal right to sue to get what is owed. Since property was not pledged as collateral, a court judgment is required in order for the lender to seize either property or assets to satisfy the amount of the debt. The consumer can choose to fight the lawsuit which, in some cases, is enough to get the creditor to drop the case. If the case is not contested, the lender wins a default judgment against the consumer.</p>
							
						<p>This may or may not be cause for alarm since the lender may not follow through to actually seize the property. More often than not, threats to seize personal property are just that. The resale value on bedroom furniture or a piece of heirloom jewelry may be negligible, but the possibility of someone taking an item of sentimental value from someone may very well convince the consumer to arrange payment. Threats to seize heirloom jewelry or furniture are often effective tactics creditors use to collect debts.</p>
							
						<b>Successful lawsuits filed by creditors can result in the following:</b>
							
						<p><b>Judgment Liens</b>. When a lien is placed on a piece of property, whether it be a home, vehicle, furniture, or electronic equipment, the title on that property is unclear. Until the title is cleared up (by settling the debt) the owner is prohibited from selling or re-financing the property involved in the lien. Once the judgment lien is won, the lender has the right to examine the assets. Then the lender must make a formal request to the court or sheriff to seize or sell the property. Certain possessions are exempt from seizure. These include household items of little resalable value. Your shirt cannot literally be taken off your back! Other items are protected from seizure depending on individual state laws including homes in some cases.</p>
							
						<p><b>Wage Garnishment and Bank Account Seizures</b>. Up to 25% of a person’s take-home pay can be intercepted and seized. More can be taken if the debt involves unpaid child support. In most cases, a consumer has the right to a hearing before wages are garnished. If a court order is won, the order for garnishment is relayed either directly to the person’s employer or to his/her bank. Laws vary widely from state to state regarding garnishments. In some states, it is quite common while in others, it is virtually impossible to carry out. Attending hearing proceedings is imperative and obtaining legal counsel is strongly advised.</p>
												
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>THE IMPORTANCE OF NEGOTIATION</b></legend>
						
						<p>When a lawsuit is filed, or even if it is threatened as a collection tactic, the special relationship between creditor and consumer is in dire jeopardy. It is almost always in the best interest of lender and debtor alike to try and maintain a mutually satisfactory arrangement through a feasible workout of some kind.</p>
											
						<p>The lender wants customers not litigants. If a debtor is unable to keep up with any agreed upon payment schedule, contact the lender and explain the situation. Avoiding calls from creditors and collection agencies will result in the debtor being seen as a”credit criminal”– someone who has no intention of settling debts incurred through products or services already obtained. Avoiding contact may cause lenders to increase the severity of collection tactics and move forward with legal action.</p>
							
						<p>It is better to be seen as a consumer who, like many, has over-estimated his/her ability to afford what has been purchased. Creditors want to see that customers acknowledge the debt and want to resolve it. From there, a compromise either can be drawn up in the form of a document or agreed to verbally over the telephone. That way, the lender maintains another customer and the consumer keeps the benefits of credit open.</p>
