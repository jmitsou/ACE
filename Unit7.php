						<li>To understand the importance of being an active listener.</li>
						<li>To determine the three components of active listening.</li>
						<li>To explore the specific listening techniques of reflective and non-reflective listening.</li>
						<li>To assess your current level of listening skills.</li>
						
						<p>There is no better way to communicate empathy, genuineness, and positive regard than to actively listen to the client. All the techniques utilized by counselors hinge upon your ability to give this form of undivided attention to the individual seeking help. What is active listening and how does it work?</p>
						
						<p>Active listening is showing respect and demonstrating interest. It is the process by which the human needs of the client are met. It allows the client to relax and therefore, communicate more information more accurately. This, in turn, benefits the counseling process as client situations, obstacles, and needs become better understood. Through the process of active listening, the barriers of communication that often cause clients to withhold crucial information are removed.</p>
						
						<p>Everyone loves a good listener. In a world where we are constantly bombarded by outside messages, the good listener is like an island of tranquility. Someone is listening to you! They are attentive and interested in what you have to say. They do not interrupt you even as you pause to form your thoughts. For many people, being attended to by a good listener is a rare experience.</p>
						
						<p>Counselors take good listening to the next level. They do this by incorporating specific techniques that serve to ensure total and accurate transmission of their clients messages. We will learn these essential techniques as we explore the components of active listening.</p>

						<legend><b>THE 3 COMPONENTS OF ACTIVE LISTENING</b></legend>
											
						<p>There are three components to active listening: what you do, what you say, and what you observe during the counseling session. Let’s look at the specific strategies for each of these processes.</p>
											
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>WHAT YOU DO</b></legend>
							
							<p>This component consists of four things that effective counselors do to create a caring and respectful communicative environment for the client:</p>
							
							<p><b>1. Maintain an upright, relaxed posture.</b> Turn so you are completely facing the client. This demonstrates that he/she has your undivided attention. Avoid crossing your arms in front of you as this suggests an aloof, judgmental attitude. Also, avoid propping your head up with your hand. This is a sure indication of either boredom or tiredness.</p>
							
							<p><b>2. Establish eye contact.</b> Always look directly into the clients eyes whenever you are speaking to the client or he/she is speaking to you. However, you will want to avoid a cold, unwavering stare.</p>
							
							<p><b>3. Use appropriate facial expressions.</b> Smile during social communication. Show seriousness (usually mouth closed and eyebrows slightly squeezed together) when the topic is of a serious nature.</p>
							
							<p><b>4. Provide non-verbal feedback.</b> This includes nodding your head to acknowledge what the client is saying. It communicates that you are paying close attention and that you fully understand what is being related.</p>
				
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>How Does What You Do Apply to Telecommunications?</b></legend>
													
						<p>You may be wondering how the physical actions of counselors have any effect during telephone communication. Surprisingly, what you can’t see, you can often hear.</p>

						<p>Vocal tone and delivery can alter dramatically depending on posture and facial expression. Have you ever answered the phone while lying in bed? An observant caller will notice a change in your voice and may comment, “You sound funny”or “Did I wake you?” Similarly, clients who need your energized assistance will pick up on clues that you are not sufficiently engaged should you be slouched over your desk or leaning back in your chair with your feet up.</p>

						<p>And is it not possible to”hear”a smile over the telephone? Try this simple experiment: Say, “Hello, how are you”first while frowning and then while smiling broadly. The words are the same but the effect is completely different.</p>

						<p><b><i>But how can I make eye contact with someone on the phone?</i></b><br />
						Here, its a matter of focus. Keep a small pad next to the telephone and write out the client’s name. This provides a visual aid that keeps your eyes from wandering around the room. By focusing on something visual that relates to the client, you can avoid becoming distracted.</p>
						
						<p><b><i>What about the use of non-verbal feedback?</i></b><br />
						Who does not make use of visual signals such as nodding and hand gestures while on the telephone? These physical movements help with the flow and effectiveness of your vocal delivery. Words that require emphasis get a boost from talking hands.</p>

						<p>One final point on the doing component of active listening. Today we often find ourselves doing more than one thing at a time. We read the paper while eating breakfast, shave or apply make up while driving, and go through our mail while watching television. While multitasking saves time in our busy schedules, it really has no place in the realm of counseling. Counseling requires that you give clients YOUR FULL ATTENTION.</p>					
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>WHAT YOU SAY</b></legend>
							
						<p>The saying component of active listening can be divided into reflective and non-reflective listening techniques. With reflective listening, counselors reflect back the content as well as the feelings of client messages.</p>
						
						<p><b>Example 1</b><br />Al: I’ve always worked for myself, but now the cost of the medical care my daughter needshas got me thinking about a job that provides benefits. Still, I can’t stand the idea of working 9-5.</p>
						
						<p>Counselor: It sounds like you’re torn between the freedom of working for yourself and the security that a benefits package can offer.</p>
						
						<p><b>Example 2</b><br />Sarah: Right now, I’m receiving child support payments which just barely cover the monthly cost of day care. But there’s still all the other expenses of running a family. I mean I have to work long hours every day.</p>
						
						Counselor: So, you’re concerned you still have to work so much even though you are receiving child support.
						
						<p>In both examples, the counselor reflected back to the client the content and emotion of the message. Using this technique facilitates communication in two ways:</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li>1. It assures the client that you received the correct message.</li>
							<li>2. It shows empathy and caring while avoiding any judgmental comments.</li>
						</ol>
						
						When counselors use reflective listening, they make reflecting statements. Reflecting statements often begin with the following phrases:
						
						<p>"It sounds like …”<br />
						"I noticed that you …”<br />
						"You sound like you feel …”<br />
						"I sense that you are feeling…”</p>						
			
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>EXERCISE: REFLECTING STATEMENTS</b></legend>
							
						
						<p>Read the following client statements. Then, create a reflecting statement in the space provided. Remember to share what you are observing about what the client is communicating. Avoid judgmental comments.</p>
						
						<p>1. Sarah: I went through so much to get them to garnish his wages so I’d get the child support on time. Now, it’s just a joke how little it really helps. Like I say, it barely takes care of what I’m paying for childcare.</p>
						
						Counselor:  <input type="text" name="" value="" />
						
						<p>2. Al: My wife offered to go back to work but for me that’s just not an option. Besides, she’s busy enough with our daughters. I’m supposed to be the one taking care of things.</p>
						
						Counselor:  <input type="text" name="" value="" />
						
						<p>3. Amy: I wish someone had been there to tell me about all these finance charges and late fees. I mean, I guess I knew about them but I thought I could manage it. It’s amazing how fast it all adds up!</p>
						
						Counselor:  <input type="text" name="" value="" />
						
						<p>4. Ray: The lay-off came as quite a shock. I worked there for seven years doing pretty much what I like to do — designing software. I didn’t think I would need a back up plan.</p>

						<legend><b>4 TYPES OF REFLECTING STATEMENTS</b></legend>
						
						<p>There are many obstacles in the encoding process. Because of this, the client may fail to communicate clearly what he/she actually means. At times, the client may not be sure what he/she is trying to say, let alone communicate the thought properly.</p>
						
						<p>To avoid misinterpreting what the client is saying, the counselor must decode the clients message through non-judgmental feedback. The client then has the opportunity to clarify his/her statement so that it more closely coincides with the intended message. Reflective listening consists of a give and take between client and counselor.</p>
						
						<b>Reflective listening involves the following four techniques:</b>
						
						<p><b>1. Clarifying.</b>This technique helps to gather accurate data, facts, or additional meanings. Asking clients to clarify a statement will alert them to the fact that they need to explain details more clearly. Encourage clients to say or do more to clarify communication:</p> 
						
						”Would you please clarify that?”<br />
						   ”I’m not sure I understand what you just said.”
						
						<p><b>2. Paraphrasing.</b> When counselors paraphrase client responses, clients gain assurance that what they said was communicated accurately. This does not mean parroting the client. Counselors communicate back client messages in their own words preceded by phrases such as:</p>
						
						”As I understand you…”<br />
						   ”Correct me if Im wrong…”<br />
						   ”In other words …”
						
						<p><b>3. Summarizing.</b>Summing up client responses helps to connect various segments of the conversation into a meaningful whole. Effective counselors determine the main point behind the details of client talk and give back a statement that puts it in a nutshell.Summarizing gives a sense of closure to a conversation:</p>
						
						”The point is…”<br />
						”In general, what you’re saying is…”<br />
						”Summing up what you said…”
						
						<p><b>4. Reflecting Feelings.</b> The focus of this method is on the tone of the client’s message. What the counselor now wants to do is reflect or mirror back the client’s feelings, attitudes, and personal meanings. In effect, the counselor tries to get emotionally in tune with the client. Avoid attempts to pamper or sympathize with the client by saying”I know what you are going through.” This is a sure way to alienate or frustrate the client. The client should sense that the counselor understands by reflective expression. Show empathy without patronizing the client:</p>
						
						”It appears that you feel…”<br />
						”It sounds like you feel…”						
						
						<p>When you begin listening reflectively, you may feel that you are not being yourself or you are being artificial. This is a natural response. As you acquire any new skill, you will experience an initial stage of awkwardness. This is true with reflective listening. Integrating these new techniques into your everyday communication takes time and practice. Remember that acquiring good listening skills is not only important in counseling but extremely useful for all types of interpersonal communication.</p>
						
						<p><b>Non-Reflective Listening</b> consists of verbal affirmations that encourage the client to continue communicating. These include short phrases such as “I see”, “Yes”,”Go on”,and “Mm-mm.” It is important to avoid any verbal phrase that is negative or judgmental like”Ugh!”, “Thats terrible!” or “Are you kidding?”</p> 
						
						<p>Non-reflective listening is particularly useful when a client appears hesitant during communication. Simple verbal encouragements go a long way toward helping a client relax and feel assured that what he/she has to say is important for the counselor to hear. Remember, you are gathering information. Being nonjudgmental and affirming are key ingredients for allowing the client to open up with the genuine and accurate information you will need to facilitate solutions.</p>
						
						<p><b>Example 1</b><br />
						Ray: My wife used to do our finances, but… (sighs)</p>
						
						Counselor: Go on.<br />
						
						<p>Ray: Well, now that she’s working and I’m not, the responsibility falls on me to keep track of the bills.<br /></p>
						
						Counselor: I see.<br />
						
						<p>Ray: But I guess I haven’t done such a good job. I mean…<br /></p>
						
						Counselor: Yes.<br />
						
						<p>Ray: I’m just not a detail-orientated guy.</p>
						
						Notice how the use of non-reflective listening helped the counselor to uncover a potentially useful bit of information, namely, the client’s belief that he’s not good with details.
						
						<p><b>Example 2</b><br />
						Amy: Basically, my parents have cut me off financially.</p>
						
						Counselor: I see.<br />
						
						<p>Amy: But…</p>
						Counselor: Please continue.<br />
						
						<p>Amy: They said I could move back with them until I get this straightened out, but that’s… I dont know.</p>
						
						Counselor: Go on.<br />
						
						<p>Amy: I really want to stay where I am. I’ve got a really fun job at a great restaurant and all my friends live around here and…</p>
						
						Counselor: Yes.<br />
						
						<p>Amy: The money’s supposed to be really good.</p>
						
						<p>Here again, the counselor uncovers some key information about the client’s situation using non-reflective listening. Specifically, her job as a waitress is supposed to bring in good money.</p>
						
						<p>Both reflective and non-reflective listening are excellent techniques for achieving the process goals of counseling. They both work to establish a non-threatening environment where interest and acceptance are expressed. Consider how the negative, judgmental phrases “Ugh!”, “Gee!”, or “That’s crazy!”could inhibit genuine and accurate communication.</p>

					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>REFLECTIVE AND NON-REFLECTIVE LISTENING</b></legend>
							
						<p>The two most important counseling techniques that optimize listening are reflective and non-reflective listening. These two techniques provide specific ways that counselors respond to clients as they speak.</p>
						
						<p><b>Reflective listening</b> is giving back to the client the messages received by the counselor. It involves reflecting statements that paraphrase, clarify, or summarize what the client has communicated. Reflective listening also involves responding to the clientsemotional state. Most importantly, reflective listening is a way of responding to client talk in a non-judgmental and accepting way. Instead of saying “Calm down” to an irate client, effective counselors say,”It sounds like you’re really upset about this.” Instead of trying to change a client’s behavior, the emotional state of the client is acknowledged.</p>
						
						<p><b>Non-reflective listening</b> is the simplest form of listening. This type of listening involves attentive silence with minimal vocal response. Appropriate nodding, verbal affirmation, and facial expressions encourage the client to continue talking. When possible, counselors should use encouraging responses that are nonjudgmental in nature. Examples of these short responses include “Please continue”, “All right”, and “Yes.”<br />
						
							  Many times the client will render cues which suggest serious hidden details. Non-reflective listening can also be utilized to draw out information which the client is hesitant to disclose. It is an important strategy for prompting the client forward with sometimes sensitive details. Money is a sensitive issue. Remember to be non-judgmental!</p>
						
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>WHAT YOU OBSERVE</b></legend>	

						<p>The third component of active listening is what you observe. During active listening, the effective counselor observes two interrelated aspects of client talk:</p>

						<ol>
							<li>What they are saying.</li>
							<li>How they are saying it.</li>
						</ol>
						
						<p>In other words, the counselor receives the client’s verbal content and the client’s emotions regarding the content they communicate.</p>				
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>EXERCISE: CLIENT EMOTIONS</b></legend>
						
						<p>Client emotions can be identified through verbal statements (what is said) and verbal behavior (how it is said). Let’s start by identifying client emotions from what is said. Our four clients will each make a verbal statement. In the space provided, write down a word to describe the emotion communicated. It is helpful to ask yourself ”How would I feel in a similar circumstance?” You may use words from the list below that describe common emotions or use your own descriptive words.</p><br />
