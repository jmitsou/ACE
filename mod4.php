					<p>Credit can be a good thing. The ability to receive funds, goods, and services in the present and pay for them over time presents us with vast opportunities that otherwise would be extremely difficult to realize. Buying a home, a car, paying for higher education, starting a business would be out of reach for most people if it weren’t for the availability of consumer-friendly loans and lines of credit.</p>

					<p>Credit also offers a convenient way to do business. You dont need to carry around large amounts of cash. Credit cards allow you to reserve a hotel room in a far off city, and once there, to rent a car and pay for emergency services if need be. The credit card offers a sense of security when traveling.</p>

					<p>However, credit has a dark side. For the uninitiated, the credit card can be a gateway into a debilitating debt situation of late fees and collection notices. Stress and frustration trigger family conflicts while credit card balances grow and bank accounts shrink. Current trends indicate that consumers are using a higher percentage of their disposable incomes toward credit card debt at the expense of savings. In fact, credit card debt is the fastest growing form of consumer debt.</p>

						<legend><b>CAMBRIDGE SURVEY</b></legend>
					
					
					<p>If credit is such a powerful financial tool, then why are so many Americans experiencing it negatively? Part of the answer might be found in a survey conducted by Cambridge Credit Counseling Corporation. They asked prospective credit counseling clients:</p>

					<p>What was the main reason or recent event that made you realize you need help with your unsecured debt?</p>

					<p>Frustration with high bank rates and fees was the number one reason cited for seeking credit counseling. This reason was given by nearly 30% of respondents while lack of financial education was cited by about 10%.</p>

					<p>What does this tell us? Given the fact that people generally do not like to put all the blame for their debt squarely on their shoulders, frustration with high bank rates and fees can be seen as a way for consumers to point their fingers at lenders as, at least, part of the problem. After all, many lending agreements today are often far from consumer-friendly.</p>

					<p>However, a lot of the frustration that consumers are experiencing is a direct result of lack of financial education. If consumers knew about the credit system and how to manage their credit to their advantage, those high interest rates and fees would not be there in the first place.</p>

						<legend><b>CREDIT LITERACY</b></legend>
					
						<p>Educating your clients about credit is an extremely important part of counseling the financially stressed. The goal of counseling is not to get people to stop using credit even though they may need to stop credit card use for the short term. Ultimately, the goal is to help clients get credit and use credit the smart, informed way so they can avoid excessive debt in the future.</p>

						<p>Establishing good credit, maintaining good credit habits, and knowing the best ways to resolve credit-card debt are all topics counselors and clients alike need to learn more about.</p>
