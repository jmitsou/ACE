						<legend><b>OBJECTIVES:</b></legend>
						
						<li>To differentiate between objective and subjective measures of financial well-being.</li>
						<li>To determine ways to assess the client’s financial situation.</li>
						<li>To define budget analysis.</li>
						<li>To explore types of spending personalities and money relationships.</li>
						
						<p>A clear sense of the client’s current financial situation will set the stage for all future financial planning and goal setting. Assessing the client’s financial condition involves not only dollars and cents calculations but also the client’s attitudes and beliefs about money.</p>

						<p>Where is the client now? To find out, counselors use objective measures such as the net worth statement, debt-to-income ratio, and budget analysis. Subjective assessments are no less important in determining a client’s overall financial situation. These assessments explore cognitive and emotional issues linked to money — how we make it, how we spend it, and how we feel about it.</p>

						<p>As a counselor, you will undoubtedly encounter a variety of individuals or couples who will present a wide range of presenting concerns. These are the problems or issues that clients initially bring to the counseling process. In some cases, clients will be experiencing various levels of financial stress or dissatisfaction. In other cases, clients will be in a crisis situation stemming from excessive debt or sudden lack of income.</p>
						
						<p>Your role as counselor is to listen to their concerns and issues in a non-judgmental way. Financial setbacks affect all but the lucky few in today’s economic landscape of corporate downsizing, soaring medical costs, and easy access to credit. Finding solutions never begins by assigning blame but rather by taking a non-judgmental look at the client’s current financial scenario and helping that client move forward.</p>

						<legend><b>OBJECTIVE MEASURES OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION</b></legend>
						
						<p><b>Calculating Net Worth</b><br />How much are you worth? That’s the question to be answered when figuring net worth. Net worth is the difference between the total amount of your assets and the total amount of your liabilities. It is the single best estimate of your level of wealth at a particular time. Periodic assessments of net worth are important because:</p>
											
						<p>The net worth statement provides a starting point from which to formulate financial goals. It is the YOU ARE HERE mark on the map from which to plot your financial course. Net worth is a way to measure financial progress. By calculating your net worth every six months or so, you can objectively gauge the success of your financial plan.</p>
							
						<p>Calculating net worth begins by listing all assets. Assets are things you own that have market value. They can be physical possessions such as a house, car, boat, jewelry or furniture. They can also be in the form of paper — cash, bank account balances, stocks and bonds, and investments.</p>
							
						<p>Figuring the total value of your assets requires 2 steps:</p>
							
						<ol>
							<li>Identify and list all items of value that you own.</li>
							<li>Determine the market value for each item.</li>
						</ol>
							
						<p><b>What Do You Own?</b><br />Step two is the more difficult since it is not always easy to appraise the value of an item particularly if it has sentimental value or is a family heirloom. Begin with liquid assets. A liquid asset is cash on hand, money in the bank or any other asset that can be converted into cash with a minimum amount of inconvenience and with no loss in market value.</p>
							
						<p>The market value of homes should be figured by observing the selling prices of homes that are similar in terms of size, type and location. It’s a good idea to then deduct seven percent for a realtor’s commission. Values for automobiles can be determined by referring to the blue bookof used car values. In other cases a professional appraiser may be needed to determine the worth of antique furniture or items resulting from hobbies or collections.</p>
							
						<p>It is important to take a conservative approach in assigning value to assets. Fair market values for many used items may be twenty to forty percent less than what they are listed for as new.</p>
							
							
						<p><b>What Do You Owe?</b><br />Liabilities will likely be easier to determine since lenders and billing departments make it a point to let you know exactly how much you owe. A liability is a debt obligation that must be paid some time in the future. Some balance sheets arrange liabilities in current (to be paid within one year) and non-current (debt obligations beyond one year) categories.</p>
							
						<p>Housing will represent the greatest liability for most homeowners. It is the unpaid portion of a mortgage. Automobile installment loans are also a big ticketliability that can be determined by referring to a bank’s payment schedule. Also, to be listed in the liabilities column are unpaid utility bills, credit-card balances and unsecured debts.</p>
							
						<p>Different types of documents can be used to figure net worth. A balance sheet uses the mathematical equation:</p>

						<p>Assets = Liabilities + Net Worth</p>

						<p>The balance is between assets on the one hand and the sum of liabilities and net worth on the other.</p>

						<p>Another document or financial statement in use today is the equity sheet which uses the more straightforward equation:</p>

						<p>Assets — Liabilities = Net Worth</p>

						<legend><b>TRACKING INCOME & EXPENSES</b></legend>
						
						<p>To budget or not to budget — that is the question. Budget by any other name is still a budget but you may wish to call it a spending plan. Budget is a word with a bad reputation. A derivative of the French word bouge meaning “small purse”, it conjures up images of penny-pinching deprivation. Whatever you call it –a budget or a spending plan — it is a valuable tool for reaching financial goals. It helps you to manage the cash that flows in and out of your life.</p>
							
						<p><b>Customize Your Expense Categories</b><br />Some categories like MORTGAGE, UTILITIES, and CAR PAYMENTS will be easy to fill in because you will have a paper trail. Other areas like FOOD, CLOTHING, and PERSONAL will take some thought. It can be helpful to divide these categories into smaller units. For example, FOOD can be broken down to GROCERIES and EATING OUT. PERSONAL can be divided into PERSONAL CARE and ENTERTAINMENT.</p>
											
						<p><b>Keep a Spending Record</b><br />It may be necessary to keep a daily expense record for the month so purchases can be accurately tracked. Guidelines for keeping an expense record are:</p>
						
						
						<li>Do not skip any days.</li>
						<li>Record every expense no matter how insignificant it might seem.</li>
						<li>Record the expense as soon as you make the transaction.</li>
						<li>Write down costs to the penny.</li>
											
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>ANALYZING THE BUDGET</b></legend>
						
						<p>Once you have the clients monthly income and expenses, it is time to analyze just what the information tells you. Budget analysis is the process used to determine how well resources are being allocated in the household. It allows you the counselor to identify the expense categories that are in control and others that may need to be reduced or modified for the short-term.</p>
						
						<p><b>Using a Spending Percentage Guideline</b><br />Although spending is (and should be) based on the specific needs, goals and values of the client, there are some general guidelines that can help clients achieve a healthier debt-to-income ratio. Here’s one example:</p>
						
						<b>SPENDING PERCENTAGE GUIDELINE</b>
						
						<table class="hoverable bordered">

						<p><b>Here’s a graphic version of a spending percentage guideline:</b></p>
						<br />
						<img src="img/Spending-pie-chart-300x292.jpg" alt="Spending pie chart" />
						
						<p>Divide the client’s monthly income by each expense category percentage to get actual amounts. Then, you will know which categories of spending to adjust. Remember, guidelines should be tweaked to meet the needs of each individual’s household.</p>
											
					</fieldset>

					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>DEBT-TO-INCOME RATIO</b></legend>
						
						<p>Another objective measure of a clients current financial condition is the debt-to-income ratio. It will tell you how much debt the client carries in relation to his or her income. Some calculations include mortgage or rent payments and some do not. Some experts recommend including all your current debt to get a more complete picture of the current debt load. It is also recommended to double the amounts of your minimum payments on revolving accounts since paying only the minimum each month is financially unhealthy.</p>
											
						<p>To calculate debt-to-income ratio, add up all monthly payments and divide by the monthly net income. If you include mortgage or rent, a healthy debt-to-income ratio is 36% or less. If you do not include mortgage or rent, the ratio should be kept under 20%.</p>
							
						<p>Different guidelines are used for different purposes. For example, the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) calculates two ratios — a front ratio (mortgage divided by the gross monthly income) and a back ratio (total fixed payments divided by the gross monthly income).</p>
							
						<p>Debt-to-income ratio calculators are freely accessed online!</p>
												
					</fieldset> 

					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>EXPENSE BREAKDOWN</b></legend>
							
						<p>Fixed Expenses are expenses that do not vary from month to month such as mortgage and car payments.</p>
											
						<p>Variable Expenses are those that change from month to month such as utilities, groceries, and clothing.</p>
						
						<p>Discretionary Expenses are those the client has complete control over such as spending for gifts, recreation and entertainment.</p>
							
						<b>SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENTS OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION</b>
							
						<p><q>We are what we consume. If we look deeply into the items that we consume everyday, we will come to know our nature very well.</q>   — Thich Nhat Hanh</p>
							
						<p>Let’s look at some subjective assessments of the financial condition. The client may wish to explore the possible reasons for the current scenario through any number of self-assessments. .. and like calculators, questionnaires that score for credit behavior and level financial literacy can be found online.</p>

 						<legend><b>OVERCOMING BAD SPENDING HABITS</b></legend>

						<p>Read the descriptions for each of the seven spending personalities. Think of three ways to overcome each type of problem spending.</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li><b>The Fanatical Shopper.</b> Its one thing to be frugal, but if someone’s obsession with getting the lowest prices is taking up a lot of time and energy, he/she is not seeing the big picture. Some fanatical shoppers hunt for months to save ten or twenty dollars but think of all the time and travel expenses involved. The effort just doesn’t make sense.</li>
							
							<p>List 3 ways to overcome fanatical shopping.</p>
							
							<p>Example: Place a value on your time and energy.</p>

								<li><input type="text" name="" value="" /></li>
								<li><input type="text" name="" value="" /></li>
								<li><input type="text" name="" value="" /></li>

							<li><b>The Impulsive Buyer.</b> This is the most common type of spender. That’s why retailers put all those knickknacks near the check out! Impulsive buyers lack control and do not plan before they shop.</li>
							
							<p>List 3 ways to overcome impulsive spending.</p>
							
							<p>Example: Leave money at home when shopping.</p>

								<li><input type="text" name="" value="" /></li>
								<li><input type="text" name="" value="" /></li>
								<li><input type="text" name="" value="" /></li>
							</ol>
							
							<li><b>The Passive Buyer.</b> Passive buyers are pushovers. They are easily persuaded to buy items they may not really want or need. They generally do not like to shop and put very little time and energy into making purchases even when they are for big-ticket items.</li>
							
							<p>List 3 ways to overcome passive buying.</p>
							
							<p>Example: Ask questions when talking to salespeople.</p>

							<ol>
								<li><input type="text" name="" value="" /></li>
								<li><input type="text" name="" value="" /></li>
								<li><input type="text" name="" value="" /></li>
							</ol>
							
							<li><b>The Ulterior Motive Spender.</b> This type of spender uses shopping as a means of escape or to deal with stress. Often there are hidden emotions at play. For example, the ulterior motive spender may shop as a form of revenge against someone. They may also spend money as a way to win someone’s approval.</li>

								<li><input type="text" name="" value="" /></li>
							</ol>
							
							<li><b>The Special Interest Spender.</b> This type of spender has a hobby, collection, or activity that is eating up a good deal of income. In some cases, the special interest spender is addicted to gambling, alcohol or drugs. Reasons behind this type of spending could be boredom or a need to be unique.</li>

							<p>List 3 ways to overcome special interest spending.</p>

							<p>Example: Find new less expensive hobbies.</p>
							
							<ol>
								<li><input type="text" name="" value="" /></li>

								<li><input type="text" name="" value="" /></li>
							</ol>
							
							<li><b>The Hot Potato Spender.</b> These spenders procrastinate and worry about making new and unfamiliar purchases. Then, at the last minute, they buy as a way to quickly put the ordeal to an end. Trouble is, what they bought is probably far from what they really needed.</li>

						<legend><b>MONEY TALK</b></legend>
							
						<p>Destructive financial behaviors are driven by our subconscious expectations, attitudes, and beliefs about money. People do not deliberately set out to overspend or get into debt. They are motivated by emotions and assumptions just under the surface that fuel everyday interactions and transactions.</p>
						
						<p>These feelings and ideas about money vary considerably from person to person. Let’s listen in on some of the subconscious talk that plays in peoples minds as they go about their daily activities:</p>
						
						<p><b>I Deserve It!</b> Some people have strong feelings of entitlement. They believe they deserve nothing but the best. Whether or not they can afford the best is a little detail they often overlook.</p>
						
						<p><b>I Don’t Expect Much.</b> Others are just the opposite. Feelings of worthlessness keep these individuals from expecting any more than the basic necessities of life. Small expectations often lead to low paying jobs and shabby living conditions. When these individuals get money, they spend it recklessly because they dont feel they really deserve it. ”Money in my pocket?”,they ask,”It must be a mistake!”</p>
						
						<p><b>’m Waiting For A Miracle.</b>I You might just win the lottery. Or maybe your rich uncle will die and leave you a fortune. Maybe youll make a killing in the stock market. Then, you will pay off all your debts in one mighty swoop. You just have to wait.</p>
						
						<p><b>I’m Showing Them I Really Care.</b> Some individuals see money as a way to show and express love and affection. How will they know how much they mean to me unless I put a price tag on it? But, when that special someone says, “You shouldn’t have!”, people in this category probably need to take that sentiment to heart.</p>
						
						<p><b>I’m Not Like Everybody Else.</b> These individuals rationalize their dysfunctional financial behavior by seeing themselves as a special case. Since they are so different and unique, they simply cannot be expected to follow the same rules as everyone else.</p>
						
						<p><b>It Really Doesn’t Matter.</b> When one considers the immensity of the universe, worrying about debt is pretty insignificant.</p>
						
						<p><b>I Need A Fix Now!</b> When the going gets tough, these people shop! A new wardrobe is such a wonderful mood enhancer!</p>
						
						<p><b>I’m Not Good With Money.</b> These individuals feel they are hopeless when it comes to personal finances because they don’t understand international economics or Calculus. Actually, balancing a checkbook rarely involves anything more daunting than simple addition and subtraction.</p>
						
						<p><b>I Will Impress You.</b> These individuals dress, eat out, travel, and spend, spend, spend to impress others. They are strongly motivated to display their level of success for all to see.</p>
						
						<p><b>I Believe Money Corrupts People.</b> This group of people shuns money as the root of all evil.Actually, its the love of money that is said to be the root of all evil. But it never hurts to be thorough, right?</p>
						
						<p>Stop and listen to the chatter in your mind. What money talk do you hear? What message or messages about money are continually playing in your head? You can use the list above or come up with you own.</p>

						<legend><b>THE 3 As OF MONEY RELATIONSHIPS</b></legend>

							<p><b>1. Money and Achievement.</b> In this category, money is strongly related to feelings of achievement. People who have this relationship with money work hard and want something tangible to show for it. A new sports car is the perfect pat on the back for a job well done. A pay raise means it’s time for a bigger house.</p>
							
							<p><b>2. Money and Approval.</b> This group sets out to please others. They want everybody to like them. They want to be accepted into the group. Here’s your “keeping up with the Jones’ set. They also tend to overspend on social occasions and gifts.</p>
							
							<p><b>3. Money and Agitation.</b> Spending is often fueled by our day-to-day emotions. People in this category purchase items to alleviate stress, feel better about themselves, or even to get back at someone. For these individuals, money is the drug of choice.</p>
