						<legend><b>INITIATING ACTION</b></legend>
						
						<p>Clients and counselors may understand the current scenario, identify desired outcomes, and come up with a viable plan for addressing an issue or goal but unless action is taken, the goal will remain out of reach.</p>
												
						<p>Taking action may be hindered by states of inertia or other barriers to positive change. Some of these obstacles to personal progress result from self-defeating behaviors that serve to sabotage success. It is important for counselors to consider the dynamics behind a client’s lack of motivation or failure to act even when specific goals are defined.</p>
						
						<p>Individuals who need to get control of their financial situation may need to develop a new and empowering perspective that will engender positive change. What is preventing clients from actually solving problems and acting on viable solutions could be the result of underlying belief systems about how much control and power they have over the world around them.</p>
						
						<p>Let’s look at two psychological models which address this issue of the power we have over the world around us: Bandura’s Self-Efficacy and Rotter’s Locus of Control.</p>
											
					</fieldset> 

					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>BANDURA’S SELF-EFFICACY</b></legend>
						<p>Albert Bandura theorized that an individual’s willingness to take action depends on the presence of two necessary conditions:</p>
						
						<p><b>1. Outcome expectations.</b><br /> In order to act, the individual must believe that the action will result in a desired outcome. For example, the individual understands that maintaining a budget is crucial for getting control of spending.</p>
						
						<p><b>2. Self-efficacy expectations.</b><br /> This is the can-do attitude. For action to take place, the individual must believe that he/she can successfully engage in the necessary behavior to achieve the desired outcome. For example, the individual is reasonably sure he/she can do what it takes to resolve outstanding debt. This means making consistent payments as well as creating all necessary conditions to ensure sufficient funds by cutting expenses, increasing income, etc.</p>
						
						<p>If either of these two conditions is missing, taking action will be avoided. On the one hand, the client may wholeheartedly believe a particular plan of action is the best option given the current circumstances. However, the client may question his or her ability to actually do what it takes to complete the necessary actions. The client will then resist taking action and find reasons — real or imagined — to continue to do nothing.</p>
						
						<p>On the other hand, the client may possess the can-do attitude but resist taking action because the action plan is not fully understood as the best course to take. Again, action will be avoided in favor of doing nothing.</p>
						
						<p><b>INCREASING SELF-EFFICACY</b><br />Help clients acquire necessary skills. Self-efficacy is based on ability. You believe you can do something because you have the skills and the resources to achieve it. Therefore, increasing self-efficacy means increasing the skills required to accomplish a desired outcome. A client may resist applying for a better paying job because he/she lacks interviewing skills. Interviewing skills can be acquired through practice. This then positively impacts the client’s self-efficacy with regards to the hiring process.</p>
						
						<p><b>Monitor progress.</b> Clients need to see the positive outcomes of the actions they take. Acknowledgment of small successes can help bolster the confidence to tackle bigger problems.</p>
						
						<p><b>Inspire by example.</b> Seeing is believing and believing is what self-efficacy is all about. Tell clients about others who overcame obstacles and resolved their problems.</p>
						
						<p><b>Encourage and challenge.</b> ”You can do it!”often leads to ”I can do it!” Self-defeating beliefs need to be challenged and replaced by the idea that desired outcomes are not only possible but also realistic.</p>
						
						<p><b>Help clients overcome anxiety.</b> Fear of failure is a sure recipe for non-action. Help clients by listening to and acknowledging their fears. Then help them to dispel them with good, solid information.</p>

					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>ROTTER’S LOCUS OF CONTROL</b></legend>
						
						<p>According to J.B. Rotter, each of us operates with either an internal or external locus of control. Those with an internal locus of control believe that the circumstances and events surrounding them depend on their own ability or behavior. Conversely, those with an external locus of control see events and circumstances as outside their direct control. Things happen by chance.</p>
											
						<p>Possessing an internal locus of control empowers the individual whereas an external locus of control subordinates the individual to outside forces which act irrespective of whatever the individual might do. Locus of control determines to a large extent how clients view the positive and negative circumstances in their lives. It informs their belief in what they can and cannot do and what they are responsible for. Therefore, it directly impacts the willingness to act.</p>
						
						<p>Individuals with an external locus of control may view creditors as preying on and victimizing consumers who end up in debt because they were fooled and confused by lending agreements they could not understand. In their view, these consumers are well-intentioned pawns in a game of intricate deception. However, those with an internal locus of control are more likely to view themselves as ultimately responsible for their own financial problems.</p>
						
						<b>An internal locus of control is advantageous for 2 reasons:</b>
						
						<ol>
							<li>Internal locus of control fosters responsibility. Consequences and outcomes are seen as direct results of the individual’s actions. The individual is less likely to blame outside forces for negative outcomes. Also, the individual is more likely to take credit for positive outcomes. This, in turn, garners self-respect and motivation to accomplish more.</li>
							<li>Internal locus of control engenders self-efficacy. The individual possesses the power to affect change. Obstacles can be overcome and necessary resources can be accessed and utilized to solve problems.</li>
						</ol>

						<legend><b>OVERCOMING SELF-DEFEATING BEHAVIORS</b></legend>
							
						<p>Albert Ellis believed that thoughts come before emotions when it comes to making decisions. Therefore, if the thinking is corrected, the emotion can be controlled. Clients finding themselves under financial strain are likely to listen to that inner voice that chants, “I MUST have this,and ”I MUST buy that.” The reality is that these “musts”cannot always be accommodated by the client’s income.</p>
								
						<p><b>Don’t fall for irrational musts.</b> Think about the word must. Is saying”I must have a lambskin jacket for the winter season”a rational statement? Obviously it isn’t. Absolutely no harm will come to someone from not having a lambskin jacket. Leave the “musts” for referring to things like hot meals and shelter. Consumer luxuries are never a must. Encourage clients to change this season’s musts to this season’s must nots.</p>
								
						<p><b>Use rational coping and self-statements.</b> A good cognitive exercise is to trade the irrational “must” for a rational statement that moves the client toward financial well-being:</p>
												
						<p>“If I went out on the town one less night a week, I could put that money toward credit-card debt without radically changing my lifestyle.”</p>
							
						<p>“It will take time and discipline to stick to a spending plan, but it will be worth it to get my finances under control.”</p>
								
						<p><b>Take the bad with the good.</b> People who overspend often focus on the supposed benefits of purchasing items while ignoring the pitfalls. If overspending is a problem, concentrate and write down the disadvantages of the behavior. Similarly, concentrate and write down all the reasons to stick to the spending plan.</p>
								
						<p><b>Never underestimate the power of distraction.</b> To combat feelings of disappointment and frustration, the simple directive to get your mind off things works wonders. Keep the mind occupied with hobbies, exercise, spending time with friends, watching movies, doing chores, or just about anything else besides money and expenses.</p>

						<legend><b>BECOMING SOLUTION-FOCUSED</b></legend>
							
						<p>You might ask him what he ordered from the menu but, at the present moment, he can’t speak. Maybe he has a medical condition. Possibly the panicked woman at his table can tell you if he has had a history of heart problems.</p>
												
						<p>You might even confer with the other diners in the restaurant; perhaps they’ve seen this sort of thing before. Or you could save the man’s life by performing the Heimlich Maneuver.</p>
							
						<p>The Solution-Focused Approach to counseling espouses the positive notion that change is a natural, everyday process, that people are not destined to be stuck in a rut, and that solutions to problems can result from simple, sometimes small adjustments made by the individual.</p>
							
						<p>The key is to help the client access what he/she already knows. The man in the illustration above who is choking on food knows the answer to his problem;  the obstruction must be removed so he can breathe again. But he needs help. This is where the Solution-Focused Approach comes in.</p>
							
						<b>This approach is particularly valuable in financial-based counseling for the following reasons:</b>
							
						<ol>
							<li><b>Financial-based counselors are not therapists.</b> The word therapy comes from the Greek word meaning “to cure.” This implies that the client is a patient that needs to be treated rather than a capable individual who requires assistance with current financial issues. The Solution-Focused Approach departs from the idea of therapeutic care. Instead, the counselor helps the client discover and activate his or her own strengths and resources.</li>
								
							<li><b>Solution-Focused Counseling is goal-oriented.</b> Clients are encouraged to identify their short and long-term goals and to identify the obstacles that are keeping them from reaching those goals. Then, it’s a matter of removing the obstacles. This can be a highly motivational exercise.</li>
								
							<li><b>The Solution-Focused Approach highlights client strengths rather than weaknesses.</b> Any real, long-term solution to a clients problem must come from the client. Thus, the counseling session becomes positive and self-affirming for the client.</li>
								
							<li><b>Solution-Focused Counseling focuses on the future.</b> Little time is spent on the past, the mistakes and the patterns of self-deception. The present moment — the counseling session is used as a springboard to discover and actualize a positive future.</li>
						</ol>
												
					</fieldset>						 

					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>REFRAMING</b></legend>
							<p>Reframing involves a change in perception that activates possibilities. It takes a situation out of its old context and places it into a new context that offers a positive outcome. For example, a client may focus on the negative aspects of excessive credit-card debt. By reframing the situation, the client can view the problem as an opportunity to organize finances and change destructive spending habits.</p>
												
							<p>A laid-off worker focuses on the dismal economy and the lack of jobs. In contrast, the focus could be on gaining new skills and/or career exploration. A student who has accumulated a mountain of credit card debt can, through reframing, use his or her personal experience with debt to initiate a campus-based education program concerning the proper use of credit.</p>
							
							<b>Let’s look at two techniques based on the concept of reframing which are utilized in Solution-Focused Counseling.</b>
							
							<p><b>The Miracle Question</b><br />
							This is a counseling technique that helps clients visualize a future in which their problems no longer exist. It begins by asking the client the following question:</p>
							
							<p>“Let’s imagine that tomorrow you wake up and are free from the burden of excessive debt. It is a miracle but since you were asleep when it happened, you are not immediately aware that anything has changed. What will you begin to notice about yourself and your surroundings that will clue you in that a miracle has occurred? How will you know the miracle has taken place? What will be different?”</p>
							
							<p>By identifying the outward effects of the miracle, the client can begin to visualize the specific conditions that created it. For example, the miracle of being free of outstanding debt may include a home where there is little or no stress, where creditors are no longer calling, and where family members are not in conflict over limited financial resources. Now, what specifically has the client
							done to create this scenario? Does the client have a different job? Has the client moved? What kind of car does the client drive? Most importantly, how does the client act within the miracle scenario?</p>
							
							<p><b>The Exception Question</b><br />
							Another technique, The Exception Question, helps clients recognize those times when things were better. The counselor asks the client to recall a time when debt was not a problem. What was different about his or her situation or behavior that created a manageable debt scenario?</p>
							
							<b>Both The Miracle Question and The Exception Question have 3 benefits:</b>
							
							<ol>
								<li>They help clients explore what it is they want different in their lives.</li>
								<li>They help clients identify the strengths and resources to make these desired differences a reality.</li>
								<li>They situate a desired future squarely in the present moment.</li>
							</ol>

					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>CREATING A SPENDING PLAN</b></legend>
							
						<p>Many clients will tend to equate budgeting with denial, sacrifice, and the postponement of gratification. They may find the act of recording expenditures and incomes a mundane chore. In fact, clients with substantial credit debt may have avoided budgeting for fear of being overwhelmed with the truth.</p>
						
						<p>It is important for counselors to help their clients gain a new perspective about budgeting. One strategy they can use right away is to avoid the word budget with all its connotations of belt tightening and instead use the term spending plan. Creating a spending plan sounds better than making a budget. It implies freedom while the other implies restriction.</p>
											
						<p>Another thing counselors can stress is that a personal budget or spending plan, far from being a mundane chore, is key to realizing financial goals. It is nothing less than an indispensable tool for mapping out a course toward increased financial freedom.</p>
						
						<b>Creating a spending plan has 4 primary benefits:</b>
						
						<ol>
							<li><b>Helps to identify overspending.</b> Once all the numbers are on paper (or on the computer screen), the client and counselor can see exactly where the money is going. Problem areas can be detected. For example, what percentage of income is going to housing costs? What is the client’s debt-to-income ratio?</li>
							
							<li><b>Promotes honest interpersonal communication and accountability.</b> Clients in debt don’t live in a vacuum. Their debt affects everyone around them. As you may know, money and how it is spent is a leading cause for arguing and discontent between partners and family members. A solid spending plan is an objective starting place for making the adjustments necessary to reach financial goals.</li>
							
							<li><b>Increases motivation.</b> When clients identify what they really want from the money they make, a tangible goal has been created. Yes, resolving financial problems can sometimes require short term sacrifices. People generally do not do without the products and services they have come to value simply because self-denial is virtuous.It is because they know there is a light at the end of the tunnel. The spending plan is like a map leading toward future rewards.</li>
							
							<li><b>Tracks your success.</b> Without a plan, there is no measuring stick to use to tell whether or not you are reaching your goals. With a spending plan in place, you can easily monitor the level of your success.</li>
						</ol>	
						
						<p>When a spending plan is utilized correctly and client motivation continues, it will function as an on-going action plan. Make sure the client keeps the plan up-to-date for each new month. Also, itis important to keep the plan flexible. Spending plans that are too strict are destined to failure.</p>
						
						<p>At the beginning of each month, the client will allocate spending for each of the categories under the appropriate column. At the end of that month, the actual amount spent will be recorded. These two amounts are then compared to see if the client’s goals for that month have been achieved.</p>
							
						<p>There are many types of spending plans including computer-based programs with built-in calculators. Keep in mind that some of the best spending plans are formulated on plain legal pads or, in some cases, even on the backs of envelopes!</p>					
					</fieldset>

					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>CUTTING CUTS</b></legend>
						
						<p>When you stop to think about it, there are many ways to economize — that is, to reduce expenses. There’s coupon and sale shopping, careful meal planning with utilization of leftovers for lunches and snacks, substituting generic products for name brand ones, watching household electricity consumption — the list is endless.</p>
											
						<p>When clients experience a loss or reduction of income, they must re-examine their current expenditures to determine which ones are essential and which ones are non-essential. In many cases, a short-term adjustment in spending may be all that is necessary. In other cases, sacrifices over the long term may be in order. The important thing is to understand how to economize and to see that cutting costs can be a source of personal satisfaction and accomplishment.</p>
						
						<p>Let’s begin by defining what it means to economize. Economizing is allocating spending so that it has the maximum benefit for everyone in the household. During times when money is scare, economizing also helps to minimize hardship. It does not necessarily mean spending less. It simply means making use of available resources for the greatest benefit.</p>
						
						<p>In fact, there are circumstances in which economizing warrants spending more. For example, loss of employment may necessitate that the client invest in his or herself through job training, education, re-locating, or purchasing new clothes for interviewing. Spending more may also be necessary when a client decides to utilize a particular skill and turn it into a way to make money. For example, someone who can bake or sew would need to invest in the materials from which to make the products they would sell.</p>
											
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>4 WAYS TO ECONOMIZE</b></legend>
						
						<ol>
							<li>Substituting products or services for less costly alternatives. This does not necessarily mean giving up quality. For example, substituting dry cleaning services for do-it-yourself dry cleaning does not mean you will be wearing dirty clothes.</li>
							<li>Conserving resources to get the most out of them, avoiding waste, and using what you have efficiently. Part of conserving is maintaining the things you own and keeping them in good working order. This includes your possessions, your skills, and your health.</li>
							<li>Cooperating with others to reduce expenses. Common examples include carpooling and sharing baby-sitting, food and housing costs.</li>
							<li>Utilizing community resources. Communities everywhere offer a wealth of free services and recreation like parks, museums, and libraries. A picnic lunch at a public park often provides a more spectacular view than most restaurants. This category of economizing also includes all the various assistance programs designed to help those who need it.</li>

						<p><b>Things to consider…</b><br />Substituting one thing for another does not necessarily mean foregoing quality. Articles of clothing sold at outlets, for example, are of comparable quality to those sold in department stores. In the case of food, it’s important to consider the nutritional value of items.</p>
						
						<p>It is interesting to note that a survey conducted in the 1960s determined that people living in poverty had healthier diets than wealthy people. (This is no longer the case due the explosion of fast food.) The food items that often cost the most tend to be processed food which has little or no nutritional value, whereas the poor man’s staple of rice and beans is undeniably a healthier, more efficient source of nutrition.</p>
						
						<p>Substituting is also the category where comparative shopping comes in. You substitute what you may have bought in the past with something less costly as you shop with new and more cost-conscious considerations.</p>
						
						<p>Conserving has a lot to do with lifestyle. Good planning and management of resources helps a consumer avoid unnecessary waste and reap the full benefits from each resource. In this day and age, most people are aware of the importance of recycling. It is important to apply conservation principles to everyday life.</p>
						
						<p>Cooperating with others can be challenging, but it can also be fun. Neighborhood garage sales and informal potluck dinners not only help save money but increase community ties and provide low-cost entertainment.</p>
						
						<p>In the next section, we will explore some of the financial knowledge necessary to put goals into action. How a client achieves financial well-being depends in large part on his or her understanding of credit and debt. The next modules focus on these two areas of personal finances.</p>

						<legend><b>SUMMARY</b></legend>
						
						<ol>
							<li>One of the goals of counseling is to help clients develop a bias toward action.</li>
							<li>According to Bandura’s Theory of Self-efficacy, in order for an individual to take action, he or she must:</li>
							<p>a. believe that the action will result in a desired outcome and<br />
							b. believe that he or she possesses the ability to do what it takes to see the action through to completion.</p>
							<li>According to Rotter’s Locus of Control, individuals possess either an internal or an external locus of control.</li>
							<li>Solution-Focused Counseling highlights a client’s strengths as opposed to weaknesses.</li>
							<li>There are four primary benefits when a spending plan is established and utilized:</li>
							<p>
							a. It helps to identify overspending.<br />
							b. It promotes honest interpersonal communication and accountability.<br />
							c. It increases motivation.<br />
							d. It tracks your success.</p>
							<li>Economizing means allocating spending so that it has the maximum benefit for everyone in the household.</li>
							<li>Four ways to economize are substituting, conserving, cooperating and utilizing community resources.</li>
						</ol>
