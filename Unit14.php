						<li>To determine the components of creditworthiness.</li>
						<li>To examine what to look for in credit-card offers.</li>
						<li>To understand the importance of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.</li>
						<li>To determine the true cost of credit.</li>
						
						<p>Choosing the best credit card involves fully understanding loan agreements and assessing repayment options. Consumers are inundated with credit-card offers that feature pre-approved introductory rates and attractive looking perks.</p>
						
						<p>It is best to shop for credit just as you would any other product. This means being pro-active by learning about the product, the terms and conditions that go with the product and how it compares with the competition.</p>
						
						<p>Getting the best deal is the first step to successfully managing credit. A consumer-friendly credit card can offer convenience and the ability to payback the principal without incurring any interest. Conversely, there are cards on the market today that make managing credit bills an extremely frustrating experience. Therefore, choosing credit should involve careful assessment by the consumer.</p>

						<legend><b>QUALIFYING FOR CREDIT ASAP</b></legend>
											
						<p>When applying for credit, a person is officially asking for a loan. The credit-card application is designed to gather the information that will determine the consumer’s level of creditworthiness. One way to look at the components that make up creditworthiness is to think ASAP.</p>
							
						<p><b>A S A P — Ability, Stability, Assets and Performance.</b><br />A stands for the <b>Ability</b> to pay back the amount of the loan granted. Lenders evaluate level of income as well as monthly expenses to determine how comfortably a consumer can handle payments. They do this by calculating the consumer’s debt-to-income ratio.</p>
							
						<p><b>Stability</b> is also considered as a factor of creditworthiness. Stability is a reflection of character. The idea is that if a person has worked and lived at the same place for at least two years, he/she is likely to make regular payments on credit bills because he/she shows regularity in maintaining the same job and the same address.</p>	
							
						<p>The second A stands for <b>Assets.</b> Lenders more readily extend credit to consumers who have things — houses, cars, boats, antiques, jewelry — things that can be liquidated, if necessary, to pay back outstanding debts. Lenders know, with all the hard penalties they can incur to prompt payments, consumers with assets can get cash under pressure.</p>	
							
						<p>P is for <b>Performance.</b> Many people do not realize it, but as soon as they are granted credit in any of its forms, they walk onto a stage. The audience is made up of the credit reporting agencies who act as critics. They gather up all your academy award nominations as well as your box office flops and disseminate them to prospective creditors who then scrutinize how you have performed over time with credit. Just like in gymnastics, consumers are given a three-digit numerical code, which acts as a predictor of future payback performances.</p>

						<legend><b>SHOPPING FOR A CREDIT CARD</b></legend>
								
						<p>Features to consider when choosing a credit card are finance charges, annual fees, grace periods, penalty fees, and balance computation methods.</p>	

						<b>Credit card features to look for:</b>
							
						    <li>Low interest rate</li>
						    <li>No annual fee</li>
						    <li>Long grace period</li>
						    <li>Low penalty fees</li>
						    <li>Adjusted balance computation method</li><br />
							
						<b>Credit card features to avoid:</b>
							
						    <li>High annual fees that can increase over time</li>
						    <li>Penalty fees for not using your card regularly</li>
						    <li>Low interest rates that quickly increase</li>
						    <li>Increased finance charges due to late payments</li>
						    <li>Increased finance charges due to exceeding your credit limit</li><br />
							
						<q>The big print giveth and the fine print taketh away.</q><br />

						<legend><b>THE TRUE COST OF CREDIT</b></legend>
											
						<p>Minimum payments maximize finance charges. The minimum payment on a credit card is calculated as a percentage of the current balance. The minimum payment will decrease as the balance is paid. However, through the magic of compound interest, the balance will remain for a long time.</p>
							
						<p>For example, let’s say there is a balance of $500 on a card with an interest rate of 18%. If the minimum payment is figured at 5% of the balance ($25), it would take 50 months to pay off the balance in which time $168.15 in interest will have been paid!</p>
							
						<p>However, if a consumer maintainspayments at $50 a month regardless of the balance, the balance can be paid off in 11 months and the cost of interest would only amount to $45.81. That’s a savings of $122.34. Also consider that by paying off the balance in less than a year as opposed to over four years, a consumer greatly reduces the risk of adding new charges to the account, thus incurring yet more interest. When calculating the true cost of credit, you begin to see how debt can have a life of its own!</p>

						<legend><b>THE EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT</b></legend>
						
						<p>This act oversees how credit is granted to consumers. That includes the entire credit evaluation and application process. Under its guidelines, lenders must inform you within 30 days whether your application has been accepted, rejected, or found incomplete.</p>
											
						<p>If your application has been rejected, you will receive a rejection letter containing two required pieces of information:</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li>The specific reason or reasons you were turned down</li>
							<li>The name of the credit bureau used to obtain your credit report</li>
						</ol>	
						
						<b>Some of the common specific reasons for rejection that meet the ECOA requirements are:</b>
							
							<li>Insufficient income</li>
							<li>Failure to pay previous obligations as agreed</li>
							<li>Insufficient number of revolving accounts</li>
							<li>Excessive inquiries</li>
							<li>Too many credit obligations</li>
							<li>No checking or savings account</li>
							<li>Too brief a period of employment</li><br />
							
						<b>Reasons that do not appear to meet the ECOA requirements are:</b>
							
							<li>Credit history</li>
							<li>Information in credit reportor</li>
							<li>Your qualifications do not meet our standards.</li>
							
						<p>Notice that these reasons are vague and unspecific.</p>
							
						<p>It is important to do some homework before applying for credit. Consumers should have a good idea as to whether their application will be accepted or denied before submitting it. Too many rejections adversely affect a credit score as we will see later in this module.</p>

						<legend><b>SUMMARY</b></legend>
						
						<ol>
							<li>Choosing credit wisely means fully understanding the terms and conditions stated in credit-card offers and disclosures.</li>
							<li>It is important to realistically assess how you plan to use and pay for your credit privileges.</li>
							<li>One way to remember the components of creditworthiness is to think ASAP — Ability, Stability, Assets, and Performance.</li>
							<li>Desirable credit-card features include low interest rate, low penalty fees, and a long grace period.</li>
							<li>Undesirable credit-card features include interest rates that can increase due to variable rates or to penalize the cardholder, high late and over-the-limit fees, and short or no grace periods.</li>
							<li>Under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, creditors must inform the consumer whether an application for credit has been approved, rejected, or found incomplete within 30 days. If credit is denied, creditors must provide the consumer with the specific reason or reasons for the rejection.</li>
							<li>Minimum payments serve to maximize the finance charges that can be added to the remaining balance.</li>
