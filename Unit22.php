						<legend><b>OBJECTIVES</b></legend>
							
						<li>To determine the difference between Chapter 7 and 13 bankruptcies.</li>
						<li>To learn about Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act.</li>
						<li>To survey the guidelines for pre-bankruptcy counseling.</li>
						<li>To identify ways to avoid bankruptcy.</li>	
							
						<p>Bankruptcy filings have increased steadily since the early 1970s to over 1.4 million each year today. Among the reasons for this steady increase are a volatile job market, soaring medical costs, divorce, a lack of savings and high levels of consumer debt. When financial setbacks occur, the balancing act of living paycheck to paycheck falls like a house of cards. Bankruptcy is a legal proceeding that can offer consumers who cannot conceivably pay all that they owe a fresh start from which to improve their financial situation.</p>
											
						<p>The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 ushered in the most comprehensive changes to the bankruptcy code since the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. Whereas, in the past, the debtor was assumed to be well-intentioned but unlucky, the new law assumes abuse unless proven otherwise.</p>
							
						<p>Consumers looking to file for bankruptcy are now required to pass a means test that determines eligibility. They are also required to receive credit counseling prior to filing either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13.</p>	
							
						<p>In this unit, we will explore the role of credit counselors as they interface with a new kind of client. The pre-bankruptcy client, for the most part, will be seeking to dissolve, not resolve, their debt. Also, their financial circumstance will be more severe than clients who are considering debt management.</p>

						<legend><b>CHAPTER 7</b></legend>
						
						<p>Sometimes referred to as a liquidation bankruptcy, Chapter 7 bankruptcy wipes out any debt filed under it. It is a last resort option for debtors who cannot pay back their creditors. It can provide a fresh start for consumers who are ready to rebuild their personal finances while avoiding past mistakes.</p>
											
						<p>Filing bankruptcy is not free and it is not easy especially now that the new bankruptcy law has gone into effect. Bankruptcy is a process that takes about four to six months. Filing costs are now over $200. Attorney fees are much higher. Paperwork is extensive and must be accurate.</p>
							
						<p><b>Eligibility</b><br />A debtor whose income exceeds the states median income for a family of the same size must pass a means test. This test is designed to ascertain whether or not the debtor, after paying for monthly living expenses, has enough disposable incometo maintain a Chapter 13 repayment plan. If the debtor does not pass this test, a Chapter 13 may be ordered by the court.</p>	
							
						<b>Below is an outline of the process:</b>	
							
						<ol>
							<li><b>The debtor files a petition with the court.</b> A Chapter 7 proceeding begins when a consumer submits a two-page petition to the court along with a series of forms that asks for:</li>
							
							<ul>
								<li>your current income and its sources</li>
								<li>your current monthly living expenses</li>
								<li>a list of your property</li>
								<li>a list of your debts</li>
								<li>any property you are claiming as exempt by state law</li>
								<li>property you owned and money you spent during the previous two years</li>
								<li>property you sold or gave away during the previous two year</li>
								<li>a certificate stating that you received credit counseling within the 180 days prior to filing</li>
							</ul>
							
							<p>In the case of an emergency such as an impending foreclosure or eviction, the debtor can file just the two-page petition and file the rest of the paperwork within 15 days.</p>
							
							<li><b>The automatic stayis put into effect.</b> Once the petition has been filed, the automatic staystops all creditor actions to collect what is owed. It is a temporary Order of Reliefthat stops garnishments, bank seizures, utility shut-offs and seizures of property.</li>
							
							<li><b>A creditorsmeetingis scheduled.</b> A week or two after the petition has been filed, the debtor receives a notice that a creditors meeting has been scheduled. This meeting is run by a court-appointed person called a bankruptcy trusteewho swears in the debtor and asks questions concerning the case. The trustee reads over the forms and asks if the information is 100% accurate. Assets that can be sold to pay off the creditors are noted. In most cases, no assets are found. Also, it is very rare that the creditors attend this meeting which can take as little time as a minute or two.</li>
							
							<li><b>Debts filed in the petition are discharged.</b> Within 3 to 6 months after the creditorsmeeting, the debtor receives a court notice that states: All debts that qualified for discharge were discharged. The debtor no longer legally owes the creditors for any discharged debts. Also, the debtor is no longer under court supervision.</li>
						
						</ol>
												
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT CHAPTER 7</b></legend>
						
						<p>There are several important points to consider before filing a Chapter 7. Below are the most important questions to ask.</p>
							
						<p><b>What debts cannot be discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case?</b><br />Nondischargeable debts fall in two categories:</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li>Debts that survive bankruptcy. These include child support obligations, tax debts and student loans.</li>
							<li>Debts the court declares non-dischargeable due to creditor objections. This could be debts incurred by fraud or malicious acts.</li>
						</ol>

						<p><b>Are there limits to the automatic stay?</b><br />Yes. In some cases, the automatic stay will not stop actions by the IRS, lawsuits to collect child support or criminal proceedings.</p>
						
						<p><b>What property is exempt in a Chapter 7 proceeding?</b>Exempt property is property that cannot be taken by the court to raise money to pay off creditors. What filers get to keep in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy varies from state to state. The following is a list of typical exemptions:</p>
						
						    <li>Motor vehicles, to certain value</li>
						    <li>A portion of the equity in a home</li>
						    <li>Necessary household furnishings and appliances</li>
						    <li>Tools necessary for employment</li>
						    <li>Pensions</li>
						    <li>Life insurance</li>
						    <li>Public benefits such as welfare, Social Security and unemployment</li>
						
						<p>Non-exempt property includes a second motor vehicle, a second home, cash, bank accounts, investments and family heirlooms.</p>
						
						<p><b>What can happen if the information filed in the petition is less than 100% accurate?</b><br />Inaccurate or incomplete information could lead to dismissal of a case. Also, if the court finds that you are deliberately hiding assets, you can be penalized severely. Remember that when you submit papers to the court, you are swearing that everything is true under penalty of perjury.</p>
						
						<p><b>How does Chapter 7 affect your credit rating?</b><br />A bankruptcy proceeding will appear as an item on a credit report for a period of 10 years. It will damage your credit rating, lower your FICO score, and make it difficult to obtain credit in the future. The worst effects of Chapter 7 can be mitigated by re-establishing credit with a secured credit card and consistently paying on time.</p>

						<p><b>What is the waiting period if I filed previously?</b><br />Under the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, a debtor can file for a Chapter 7 eight years from the date of the first filing.</p>
												
						<p><b>Can I file without an attorney?</b><br />You can but it is not advisable. Specialized knowledge is often needed concerning types of debts, exemptions, and state laws. In the case of a partnership or cooperation, an attorney is required.</p>
						
						<p><b>Can I get free legal assistance?</b><br />Legal assistance is available for some who meet income guidelines. In some cases, a petition preparer is used to help create the filing forms. However, they are prohibited from giving legal advice or representing you in court.</p>
						
						<p><b>Should I file separately or jointly with my spouse?</b><br />Whether you should file a joint petition or a separate one depends on several factors that involve the types of debt incurred, when they were incurred, property you own, and state laws. There are two types of marital property ownership — community property and common law. Currently, nine states apply the community property rules while the other states follow common law rules. What rules your state follows and how they can affect your petition should be sorted out by a qualified bankruptcy attorney prior to filing.</p>
						
						<p><b>Do I have to go through the pre-bankruptcy counseling?</b><br />Under the new law, you must complete a 90-minute counseling session within 180 days of filing. The counseling focuses on the availability of credit counseling and other alternatives to bankruptcy. A certificate of completion must be included in your petition. This requirement can be waived if the petitioner is disabled or on active duty in the military.</p>
						
						<p><b>Do I have to obtain debtor education before my case is discharged?</b><br />As with the pre-filing counseling, this is one of the new requirements in the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act. It states that a certificate must be filed with the court within 45 days of the creditorsmeeting or else the court will close the case without issuing a discharge.</p>
						
						<p><b>What does the court require as far as wage statements?</b><br />Filers must include a statement of current monthly income with their petition. The court defines current monthly income to mean the average of the income you have received over the past six months. This is one of the requirements of the new bankruptcy law.</p>
						
						<p><b>Why are there so many people filing bankruptcy?</b><br />Many factors contribute to the current level of bankruptcy filings. Unforeseen events such as loss of income or a medical emergency can devastate an individual or a familys financial situation particularly when there is no money set aside to deal with these events. Other contributing factors include destructive spending habits, high levels of consumer debt and poor use of credit.</p>
						
						<p><b>How can bankruptcy be avoided?</b><br />Do not borrow more than your income can handle. Establish an emergency fund equal to 3 – 6 months of your current income. Use a spending plan to meet financial goals. Research and obtain medical insurance.</p>
											
					</fieldset> 
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>CHAPTER 13</b></legend>
						
						<p>Sometimes called the wage earner’s plan, Chapter 13 is a reorganization bankruptcy whereby the debtor repays all or a portion of what is owed over a five year period. While the debtor is under court supervision, the court provides protection from creditor actions such as garnishments and seizures.</p>
						
						<p><b>Eligibility</b><br />To be eligible for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you must show the court, through a repayment plan, how you will pay off your debts. You must have sufficient disposable income to maintain a monthly payment plan. Disposable income is that portion of income left over after meeting basic living expenses.</p>
						
						<b>Below is a summary of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding.</b>
						
						<p>A Chapter 13 proceeding begins when a debtor files a repayment plan with the court. Included are forms listing your assets, your income, your monthly expenses and the nature and amount of your debt.</p>
						
						<p>Payments begin within 30 days of the filing. The debtor makes payments to the trustee who then distributes the money to the various creditors. In this way, Chapter 13 resembles a debt management plan. And like debt management, Chapter 13 requires a high level of commitment due to the extended time frame and the fact that on-going money pressures continue as always.</p>
						
						<p>The debtor can have the case modified at any time. Life goes on. During a five year repayment plan, things happen. You may suddenly find yourself without a job. Whether temporary or permanent, the trustee has the discretion to modify your plan to accommodate your needs. Depending on the situation, the trustee may give you a grace period or reduce the monthly payment.</p>
						
						<p>In the event that the bankruptcy court will not let your plan be modified, you have the right to:</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li>Convert to Chapter 7</li>
							<li>Have the court dismiss your case.</li>
						</ol>
						
						<p>Certain remaining debts at the end of the five year repayment plan are wiped out in a super-discharge. Under the new law, debts incurred through fraud, theft or malicious acts are no longer included in the super-discharge.</p>

					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>COMPARING CHAPTER 7 AND CHAPTER 13</b></legend>

						<p>While most people who file for bankruptcy file for Chapter 7, there are reasons to file for Chapter 13. Here are the primary considerations:</p>
							
						<ol>
							<li>You filed a Chapter 7 already. If you filed for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy within the last eight years, you are still eligible for a Chapter 13 .</li>
							<li>You want to protect nonexempt property. Another reason to file for Chapter 13 is that you may have valuable nonexempt property you want to keep. Under a Chapter 7, your valuable assets are liquidated to pay the creditors a portion of what you owe. Chapter 13 offers protections from creditor actions against your property.</li>	
							<li>You have delinquent secured debt. If you are behind on your mortgage payments or car loan, a Chapter 13 allows you to keep your property while you catch up through a reorganization plan. Under a Chapter 7, you may have to give up your property.</li>	
							<li>You want to protect your cosigner. In a Chapter 7, the creditors may go after a cosigner of a loan appearing in the petition. In other words, even though the debt is discharged, a cosigner is still responsible for the debt. Under a Chapter 13, you are solely responsible for the debts through your repayment plan.</li>	
							<li>You want to do “the right thing.” Some people will not consider dissolving their debts. They feel it is their moral obligation to pay off their debts as best as they can. A Chapter 13 can make this possible.</li>
						</ol>
							
						<b>Which type of bankruptcy is right for which circumstance depends on:</b>
							
						<p><b>Eligibility.</b> Filing for Chapter 7 under the new bankruptcy code requires that you take a means test. Your income and expenses are put through a series of calculations in a determination to find funds for a monthly repayment plan. If you show consistent money left over after living expenses, you may be ordered into a Chapter 13.</p>
							
						<p>To be eligible for a Chapter 13, you must have adequate income to cover your basic living expenses and be able to maintain a court supervised payment plan lasting 5 years.</p>

						<a href="http://" class="teal-text">REASONS FOR FILING</a>
												
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>THE BAPCPA</b></legend>
							
						<p>The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA) went into effect on October 17, 2005 after a long and contentious debate in Congress. Whereas in the past, bankruptcy filers were seen as well-intentioned victims of circumstance, they are now considered to be abusing the system unless proven otherwise.</p>
											
						<p>Its many provisions limit Chapter 7 eligibility, increase the paperwork and cost of filing, and diminish the benefits of a Chapter 13. The pendulum that swung in favor of debtors with the passage of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 has just swung in the opposite direction in favor of creditors.</p>
							
						<p>As a counselor, it is important that you assess your attitude toward bankruptcy. Do you think debtors have a right to discharge debts they cannot pay? Do you think that the creditors are to blame for soliciting consumers to take on debt they can ill afford? Are millions of bankruptcy filers abusing the system each year?</p>	
						
						<p>Studies show that the primary causes of bankruptcy are job loss, health problems, and divorce. Others, however, point to credit-card debt and frivolous spending as the real culprits. However you view the subject of bankruptcy, it is essential that you, as a counselor, remain nonjudgmental toward clients who are considering this option.</p>
						
						<b>We will now survey the most important changes ushered in by the new law.</b>
											
					</fieldset> 
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>CHANGES IN THE BANKRUPTCY LAW</b></legend>
						
						<ol>
							<li><b>Limits Chapter 7 Eligibility.</b> Under BAPCPA, abuse is presumed if a debtors income is above the states median income for a family of the same size. The debtor, in this case, must prove there are no funds available to pay back the creditors.</li>
							
							<p>A means test is administered to determine whether or not a debtor can afford to pay at least $100 a month to the creditors. However, the means test does not use the debtor’s actual income and expenses to make its calculations. The debtor’s income is expressed as the average income of the last six months regardless of whether or not the debtor has experienced a job loss. Also, expenses are based on IRS rules that state what reasonable expenses are.</p>
							
							<p>Critics of the new law include consumer advocates and women’s groups who
							see an essential financial safety net removed. If credit-card debt cannot be wiped out, that’s less money that can go toward essential expenses such as child support. On the other hand, proponents of the law see the means test as the primary tool for reducing the epidemic numbers of bankruptcy filings.</p>
							
							<p>Filers who do not pass the means test must file either a Chapter 13 and enter
							a five year repayment plan or slip further into debt.</p>
							
							<li><b>Limits to Chapter 13.</b> While many debtors who are ineligible for a Chapter 7 will presumably enter a Chapter 13 repayment plan, several changes in this type of bankruptcy make it less powerful:</li>
							
							<ul>
								<li>Many debts that were dischargeable in a superdischarge can no longer be discharged. These include debts resulting from theft, fraud, certain back taxes, and fines and damages.</li>
								<li>An auto lien can no longer be stripped whereby the debtor pays only the secured portion of the debt if the vehicle was purchased within 910 days of the filing.</li>
								<li>All repayment plans must last five years. In the past, some plans lasted only three years.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<li><b>Mandatory credit counseling.</b> All debtors must receive credit counseling from an approved budget and credit counseling agencyeither in an individual or group briefing within 180 days prior to filing bankruptcy.</li>
							
							<p>There are exceptions to this requirement in the case of an emergency and the debtor could not receive credit counseling within five days or if the U.S. Trustee has determined that the approved agencies are not adequate to provide the required counseling. Any debt management plan that is developed must be filed with the court.</p>
							
							<li><b>Limits on the automatic stay.</b> The automatic stay no longer stops or postpones evictions, actions against a drivers license or professional license, lawsuits to establish paternity, child custody, or child support or divorce proceedings.</li>
							
							<li><b>Increased time between filings.</b> A Chapter 7 debtor cannot receive a discharge if a prior discharge was received within eight years as opposed to six years of the new filing.</li>
							
							<li><b>Mandatory debtor education.</b> A debtor can be denied a discharge if the debtor does not complete a course in personal financial management that is approved by the U.S. Trustee.</li>
							
							<li><b>Limits to the discharge.</b> Debts owed to a single creditor totaling more the $500 in luxury goods purchased within 90 days of filing are considered nondischargeable. Also, nondischargeable are cash advances totaling $750 within 70 days.</li>
							
							<li><b>Increased paperwork.</b> A case can be dismissed if the debtor fails to submit the following documents:</li>
							
							<ul>
								<li>List of creditors</li>
								<li>Schedules of assets and liabilities, income and expenses</li>
								<li>Certificate of credit counseling</li>
								<li>Evidence of payment from employers received 60 days prior to filing</li>
								<li>Statement of monthly net income and any anticipated increase in income or expenses after filing</li>
								<li>Tax returns or transcripts for the most recent tax year</li>
								<li>Tax returns filed during the case including tax returns for prior years that had not been filed when the case began</li>
								<li>A photo ID</li>
							
							</ul>
							    
							
							<li><b>Required verification by the attorney.</b> Attorney fees are expected to rise substantially due to increased legal responsibility. Attorneys must verify and attest to the accuracy and completeness of a filers petition. Numerous other provisions in the law address homestead exemptions, domestic support obligations, taxes, and student loans. The above list in no way should be consulted as a legal resource. Many provisions are extremely detailed such as the limits imposed on the automatic stay and how the means test is administered and interpreted.</li>
							
							<p>In summary, filing bankruptcy after October 17, 2005 takes longer, costs more and offers fewer protections from creditors. New duties are imposed on debtors and their attorneys. The previous concept of the unfortunate debtor who is entitled to relief from debts has been replaced by the idea that the debtor is abusing the system unless proven otherwise.</p>
						</ol>
												
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>THE BANKRUPTCY CLIENT</b></legend>
							
						<p>If you are an approved agency to provide the required pre-filing credit counseling or predischarge education, you will be interfacing with a different type of client than one who is seeking to resolve debts through debt management or budget counseling. The bankruptcy clientwill most likely be experiencing a more severe level of financial distress than the typical client who seeks credit counseling.</p>
							
						<p>One important distinction is that the counseling is mandatory for the bankruptcy client. This client may view the required counseling as a pointless exercise and express their frustration, anxiety or even anger toward you.</p>
							
						<p>As a result, the bankruptcy client may lack motivation to consider options other than filing. By the time the client contacts you, a decision has already been made to file bankruptcy. This may have been an extremely hard decision to make after a long period of time dealing with the effects of delinquent debt. Unlike a client who pro-actively contacts an agency, the bankruptcy client is not seeking to pay down debt. Instead, the client is seeking relief from debt.</p>
							
						<p>Who is the bankruptcy client? Contrary to what you might think, the bankruptcy client is middle class, more likely to have attended college and more likely to own a home than the average American. This is not hard to believe once you consider that you need income to incur debts and that one of the reasons for filing bankruptcy is to protect assets.</p>
							
						<p>A Harvard study conducted by Elizabeth Warren found that one half of all bankruptcies are triggered by sudden uninsured medical expenses. Other leading causes of bankruptcy are job loss and divorce.</p>					
					</fieldset> 
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>PRE-BANKRUPTCY COUNSELING</b></legend>
						
						<p>One of the biggest changes in the bankruptcy law is the requirement for consumers who want to file for bankruptcy to complete a credit counseling briefing. It is the first time in history that credit counseling is mandatory.</p>
						
						<p><b>GUIDELINES</b><br />The U.S. Trustee of the Department of Justice, which oversees various aspects of the new law, has drafted guidelines for the required counseling:</p>
										
						<ul>
							<li>The briefing must be at least 90 minutes long.</li>
							<li>It can be completed in either an individual or group setting.</li>
							<li>It should cost about $50. (Couples, in some cases, are charged $75.)</li>
							<li>The requirement can be waived for certain filers including those with disabilities and those on active duty in the military.</li>
						</ul>	
							
						<b>The counseling must consist of:</b>	
							
						<ol>
							<li>An analysis of the current financial situation.</li>
							<li>A discussion of the factors that caused the current situation.</li>
							<li>A discussion of all the options for resolving the debt.</li>
							<li>Guidance in developing a plan of action.</li>
						</ol>	
							
						<b>Later, we will examine these four components in detail. Here is a link to the FAQs of those who wish to provide bankruptcy counseling. Each answer displays the date it was updated:</b>

					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>CLIENT EMOTIONS</b></legend>
								
						<p>Some authors writing on the subject of bankruptcy claim that the stigma of bankruptcy is a thing of the past. Others, including bankruptcy attorneys, report that creditors meetings are often very emotional occasions that can cause tears, embarrassment and shame.</p>
							
						<p>As counselors, it is important to remain sensitive to the emotional side of bankruptcy. For many, filing bankruptcy is a sign of personal failure. Some may be hesitant to give sensitive information. Others will express confusion about the entire bankruptcy process.</p>
							
						<p><b>What You Can Do?</b><br />How can counselors help quell the shame and guilt that often accompanies the decision to file bankruptcy? It is important for clients to know that many people from all walks of unexpectedly fall on hard times. A volatile job market, soaring medical costs and a culture of buy now pay later has left large numbers of Americans financially vulnerable.</p>
							
						<b>If they take nothing else away with them after a pre-bankruptcy counseling session, it should be that they are not alone. In fact, you are in good company. Consider the following list of famous people who have filed bankruptcy:</b>
							
						<ul>
							<li>Rembrandt</li>
							<li>Mozart</li>
							<li>Thomas Jefferson</li>
							<li>James Whistler</li>
							<li>Mark Twain</li>
							<li>Oscar Wilde</li>
							<li>Henry Ford</li>
							<li>Charles Goodyear</li>
							<li>Walt Disney</li>
							<li>Donald Trump</li>
						</ul>	
							
						<p><b>Use verbal encouragement to draw out information from hesitant clients.</b> Short responses such as “go on”, “I see” and “yes” let the client know you are giving your undivided attention.</p>
							
						<p><b>Demonstrate positive regard by addressing the client by name and focusing on the client’s strengths and past successes.</b></p>
							
						<p><b>Remain non-judgmental.</b> Avoid judgmental reactions to client statements such as ”That’s terrible!” Instead, use objective responses such as “I see.” Also, do not assign blame when examining past mistakes.</p>

						<legend><b>GUIDELINES IN DETAIL</b></legend>
											
						<p>The 4 components that are required under U.S. Trustee guidelines correlate with the problem-solving process outlined in Module III. Let’s look at each one in comparison with the stages of counseling we discussed earlier.</p>
							
						<ol>
							<li><b>Analysis of the clients current financial condition.</b> Gathering all the facts while establishing and building rapport is the first step in the problem-solving process. Its finding out where the client is now. During this first stage, it is essential to view the credit report. If the client does not have a current copy, you can get a free copy by going to www.annualcreditreport.com. The report will help you identify the kinds and amounts of debts and to ascertain whether or not any court actions are listed. Also, it is important at this stage to check the report for accuracy. Any errors found can be contested under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.</li>
								
							<li><b>Discussion of the factors that caused the current condition.</b> This is the other side of gathering all the facts. While avoiding the blame game, you examine where the client is now in terms of on-going issues that may involve destructive spending habits, poor credit behavior, or conflicts over money. Other factors contributing to insolvency may include job loss, lack of medical insurance and divorce. Each factor should be discussed so that the underlying causes of debt can be addressed as well as the debt itself. Solutions are added to the action plan.</li>
								
							<li><b>Discussion of the alternatives to address the current condition.</b> This component correlates with the second step in the problem-solving process that tries to determine where the client wants to go. What is the preferred scenario? In this case, options are considered for resolving debt that may or may not necessitate filing for bankruptcy. Determining the right alternative depends on the clients level of debt and overall financial situation. The deeper a client is in debt, the fewer the options will be. Also, each option carries with it a human factor. Can this individual successfully follow through with the action plan? Are values compromised? Will the action plan cause stress in the household? Do destructive spending habits need to be addressed?</li>
								
							<li><b>Development of a plan of action.</b> The fourth step is often the trickiest. It correlates with the final step in the problem-solving process. How will the client reach the identified preferred scenario?</li>
						</ol>
							
						<p>A good action plan will include specific measures of success and specific time frames. Obstacles for each action to be undertaken will need to be identified and overcome. Click the link below to see an example of an action plan.</p>

					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>CONSUMER WORKOUT</b></legend>
							
						<p>Consumers should contact their creditors whenever they are having trouble making a payment. Generally, creditors will want to maintain a positive relationship with customers by allowing a temporary or permanent modification for repayment.</p>
							
						<p><b>Financial side:</b> Is the setback temporary? Will the consumer have regular income in the future? How long has the debt been delinquent? Is it in collections? In the best case scenario, a consumer should contact his or her creditor in anticipation of paying a bill late. However, if the consumer is late by a month or two, negotiation might work. Success is also contingent on the specific creditors involved and their policies concerning payments.</p>
							
						<p><b>Human side:</b> Negotiating with creditors can be time consuming and frustrating. A client should understand that this option requires assertiveness and perseverance.</p>
											
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>CREDIT COUNSELING</b></legend>
							
						<p>Many people simply do not have the time or skills necessary to negotiate with all the creditors they owe money to. Credit counseling provides a liaison between consumers and lenders.</p>
							
						<p><b>Financial side:</b> A debt management plan is a viable option if the client can show money left over each month after paying for expenses. The income must be sufficient and regular enough to maintain the payment plan worked out.</p>
							
						<p><b>Human side:</b> Maintaining the plan, which could last from three to five years, takes commitment. Individuals in a debt management plan will need to change their spending habits and their use of credit.</p>					
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>DEBT CONSOLIDATION</b></legend>

						<p>This option could make sense for individuals who owe several creditors and wish to manage their debt by making one monthly payment.</p>
							
						<p><b>Financial side:</b> Taking out a loan only makes sense if the individual has a steady source of income and a fair to good credit rating. If the debtor is a homeowner, they might consider a home equity loan. Other types of consolidation such as 0% transfers come with severe penalties that could exacerbate the debt situation.</p>
							
						<p><b>Human side:</b> Taking on more debt, especially trading in unsecured debt for secured debt in the case of a home equity loan, can mean added financial stress. Unless the issues that caused the debt in the first place are addressed, this is probably not a good option.</p>					
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>CHAPTER 13</b></legend>	
											
						<p>If the individual needs asset protection while paying off debts, this may be the best option. However, did you know that the vast majority of debtors who file for a Chapter 13 never complete their payment plan?</p>
							
						<p><b>Financial side:</b> As stated earlier in this chapter, a debtor must submit to the court a repayment plan that shows adequate money each month to maintain payments.</p>
							
						<p><b>Human side:</b> Like debt management, this option takes commitment. Also, you must also consider that, during the five-year plan, your finances are subject to court supervision.</p>
												
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>DEBT SETTLEMENT</b></legend>
						
						<p>If you are deep in debt and wish to avoid bankruptcy, debt settlement could be a way to resolve delinquent debt by paying a reduced, negotiated portion of the debt.</p>
							
						<p><b>Financial side:</b> The debtor must raise funds to pay the negotiated amount. This could mean selling an asset or asking for help from a family member. Also, to be considered is the damaging effect this will have on the credit rating.</p>
							
						<p><b>Human side:</b> This option promises a quicker way of getting out from under debt and it may help some individuals avoid bankruptcy. However, creditor actions to collect what is owed will not stop until the reduced amount is paid.</p>
												
					</fieldset> 
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>CHAPTER 7</b></legend>
							
						<p>This is the last resort option as long as the debtor can pass the means test and does not have a previous Chapter 7 within the last eight years.</p>
							
						<p><b>Financial side:</b> After expense allowances, the debtor must show close to no disposable income for paying off debts. Also ask,”Will enough of my debts be discharged to make it worth doing?”and “Is there property I want to keep that I might have to forfeit?”</p>
							
						<p><b>Human side:</b> Consider how the client feels about bankruptcy. For some, the emotional toll may be too much.</p>
							 
						<p><b>Legal Advice:A Working Definition</b><br />It is more important than ever to define legal adviceand understand what you, as a counselor, can and cannot do. It is illegal for anyone other than an attorney to do the following:</p>
							
						<ul>
							<li>Interpret the law by explaining what a statute, regulation, or case means.</li>
							<li>Prepare legal documents or interpret any legal documents originating from a court or an attorney.</li>
							<li>Offer an opinion as to how a clients specific legal problem should be handled.</li>
						</ul>	
							
						<p>Counselors may not say, “I think you should file bankruptcy” or “If I were you, I would file a Chapter 7.”</p>
							
						<p>However, in developing a plan of action, the counselor can say, “It appears that bankruptcy may be an option”or “It looks like you may need an attorney.”</p>
											
					</fieldset>

					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>PRE-DISCHARGE DEBTOR EDUCATION</b></legend>
											
						<p>Also mandated under the new law is a two-hour course in personal financial education. In order to be granted a discharge by the court, the debtor must complete the course within the 45 days following the creditors meeting. According to the U.S. Trustee’s Office, this course must include the following 4 components:</p>
							
						<ol>
							<li><b>Budget development.</b> This includes setting short and long-term financial goals and understanding the difference between fixed, variable and discretionary expenses.</li>
								
							<li><b>Money management.</b> Debtors would explore needs versus wants, the importance of savings and insurance, and effective shopping strategies.</li>
								
							<li><b>Using credit wisely.</b> This component would examine the types and availability of credit and loans, avoiding credit problems, and understanding credit reports and scores.</li>
								
							<li><b>Consumer resource information.</b> The course would include a survey of resources for the consumer such as assistance programs as well as consumer rights.</li>
						</ol>
							
						<p>As with the pre-bankruptcy counseling, the course must be administered by an approved agency.</p>

						<legend><b>AFTER BANKRUPTCY</b></legend>
						
						<p>If the premise of bankruptcy is to provide a fresh start for consumers whose debt situation is truly debilitating, any counseling or education would be incomplete without providing guidance for a post-bankruptcy action plan.</p>
						
						<p>Generally speaking, clients will want to re-establish their credit as soon as possible while at the same time, avoiding the past mistakes that may have contributed to the need to file bankruptcy. The debtor who has just come out of a bankruptcy should understand that there is nothing forever about credit. Although, a bankruptcy can stay on your credit report for up to 10 years, the effect it has on your credit score can be lessened through the responsible use of credit. The best strategies are:</p>
						
						<p><b>Get your credit report and fix any errors.</b> As you know, credit reports can contain mistakes that translate into more money out of your pocket. Make sure that any debts that were filed under the bankruptcy are not still listed as open and overdue. If they are still listed as overdue, the debtor must contact the credit bureaus and insist that the accounts be reported as included in bankruptcy. Also, check to make sure the correct type of bankruptcy is listed. If you filed a Chapter 13, make sure it does not report it as a Chapter 7.</p>
						
						<p><b>Apply for a secured credit card.</b> Considering all the multiple bankruptcies filed in recent years, it is more than just possible to re-establish credit in a relatively short amount of time. You may not qualify for a regular credit card right away but you can get a secured credit card. This type of credit card draws money from an amount you deposit in the bank. By making charges on a secured card and making regular payments on time, you can get back in the credit game. Also, it is best not to charge more than 30% of your credit limit.</p>
						
						<b>Three things to keep in mind:</b>
						
						<ol>
							<li>Beware of secured cards that carry high application or annual fees.</li>
							<li>Ascertain whether or not the card issuer reports to the three credit bureaus. If not, you won’t be getting creditfor your good use of credit.</li>
							<li>After a 12 — 18 month period of sound credit use, you should be able to upgrade the secured card to a regular card.</li>
						</ol>
						
						<p>Apply for an installment loan. Establish that “healthy mix” that creditors like to see by getting an installment loan. If you have a student loan, make sure it is current and try to pay more than the minimum payment each month. Also, do not think you will not qualify for a mortgage. Typically, you could qualify for a Federal Housing Administration Loan in as little as six months after bankruptcy.</p>
						
						<p>After bankruptcy discharge, consumers are often inundated with high-cost credit offers. These offers promise to rebuild your credit but, in reality, can derail your post-bankruptcy fresh start. It is important to choose new credit very carefully. Although, many consumers coming out of bankruptcy will be anxious to obtain credit again, it is best not to succumb to creditor solicitations and, instead, pro-actively seek the best credit options.</p>
						
						<p>Whatever alternative the client chooses for dealing with debt, it is important that he or she create a spending plan that supports it. Only through a spending plan can money be allocated to resolve the debt while avoiding debt in the future.</p>
						
						<p>Above all, it is important to remember that bankruptcy is not the end of the road but a chance for a new beginning.</p>

						<legend><b>SUMMARY</b></legend>
						
						<ol>
							<li>Chapter 7 bankruptcy wipes out any debt filed under it.</li>
							<li>Chapter 13 bankruptcy reorganizes debt into a monthly payment plan and offers certain court protections from creditor actions.</li>
							<li>Considering bankruptcy involves knowing which debts are dischargeable and what property you are allowed to keep.</li>
							<li>The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act is the most extensive revision of the bankruptcy code since the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978.</li>
							<li>A means testis applied to determine bankruptcy eligibility.</li>
							<li>New counseling and education is required for those filing bankruptcy. Consumers must receive counseling prior to filing bankruptcy and personal financial management education before receiving a discharge.</li>
