						<legend><b>OBJECTIVES</b></legend>
						
						<li>To learn ways to interview effectively.</li>
						<li>To know when to use open-ended and closed-ended questions.</li>
						
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>Good interviewers:</b></legend>
							
						<ol>
							<li>ask short, direct questions.</li>
							<li>ask only one question at a time.</li>
							<li>ask questions that do not need to be explained.</li>
							<li>wait for the client to answer.</li>
							<li>do not answer their own questions.</li>
						</ol>
						
						<p>Numbers 4 and 5 can be hard to remember especially for those of us who like a fast-paced exchange of information. However, some clients require several seconds to respond to a question. They are more deliberate and thoughtful and need that extra time to consider their answer. For these clients, silence can indeed be golden.</p>
					
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>OPEN-ENDED AND CLOSED-ENDED QUESTIONS</b></legend>
							<p>There are two types of questions: Open-ended questions and closed-ended questions. Each has its particular use during the interview.</p>
							
							<p><b>Open-Ended Questions</b> encourage clients to explore their thoughts and feelings. Often they involve getting clients to analyze their situation or evaluate options or courses of action to be taken.</p>
											
							<p>Open-ended questions usually require an answer longer than just a word or two.</p>
							
							<p><b>Open-ended questions are used for the following reasons:</b></p>
							
							<ol>
								<li>To ask for a statement of the problem. For example:</li>
								<p>“How can I help you?”</p>
								<p>“Can you describe the trouble you’re having?”</p>
								
								<li>To explore alternatives to solving the problem. For example:</li>
								<p>“How have you dealt with this before?”</p>
								<p>“Have you thought about keeping a spending record?”</p>

								<li>To refocus the client back to the topic at hand. For example:</li>
								<p>“Let’s get back to your unsecured debt. What solutions have you sought out before?”</p>
								
								<li>To ask the clients opinion concerning an option or course of action. For example:</li>
								<p>“How does that sound to you?”</p>
								<p>“What do you think about this solution?”</p>
								
							</ol>
							<ol>
								<p><b>Closed-Ended Questions, </b>on the other hand, are used to get factual information from the client. They can often be answered with a “yes”,a “no” or one or two words.</p>
								
								<p><b>Closed-ended questions are asked for the following reasons:</b></p>
								
								<li>To obtain specific information. For example:</li>
								<p>“Did you sign a lease?”</p>
								<p>“Who is your employer?”</p>
								
								<li>To ask the client to clarify a statement you did not fully understand. For example:</li>
								<p>“I’m not sure I understand. Are you saying you co-signed on the loan?”</p>
								
								<li>To coordinate or schedule future plans. For example:</li>
								<p>“Can you send me your last billing statement?”</p>
								<p>“Do you think you can call tomorrow with that information?”	</p>
							
							</ol>
				
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>ASKING OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS</b></legend>
							<p> Asking open-ended questions requires that you begin with an initial phrase that invites the client to speak freely and openly. Examples of initial phrases for open-ended questions are:

							<p>“How do you feel about…”<br />
								“Could you tell me about…”<br />
								“What do you think…”</p>

							<p>Notice that the phrases above cannot be answered with a simple “yes”or “no.”</p>


							<p>Since open-ended questions may require extended answers from clients, it is important to provide verbal encouragement through non-reflective listening as the client speaks. This will help the client answer open-ended questions more completely.</p>

							<p>After asking an open-ended question, wait for the client to respond. Avoid rephrasing the question, explaining the question or answering the question yourself. Give the client those five (or even ten) seconds necessary to answer these sometimes difficult questions.</p>					
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>EXERCISE: OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS</b></legend>		
							<p>Read the client statements below. Then, create your own open-ended questions to obtain more information or a better understanding about the situation.</p>
							
							<p>1. Al: My security business requires that I travel quite a bit and I tend to use my credit cards when I’m on the road. Trouble is, I lose track of all my expenses. When I get home, I try to play catch up but before you know it, I’m staring at late charges.</p>
							
							Counselor: <input type="text" name="" value="" />
							
							<p>2. Amy: I was studying marine biology. I guess I thought I could work at Sea World you know, training dolphins or something. I’m just trying to be more realistic now. I know I need to make money to get out of this debt.</p>
							
							Counselor: <input type="text" name="" value="" />
								
							<p>3. Sarah: My ex-husband gets the kids every other weekend that’s the arrangement we worked out with the judge. Anyway, that’s my time to take care of all the things I have no time for. It just seems like the bills always get pushed to the end of my to do list.</p>
								
							Counselor: <input type="text" name="" value="" />
								
							<p>4. Ray: Not working is actually harder than working. At my old job, I got to put together my own projects at a pace that was right for me. That’s what was so great about that company.</p>	
							
							Counselor: <input type="text" name="" value="" />
												
					</fieldset>

					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>ASKING CLOSED-ENDED QUESTIONS</b></legend>
							
							<p>Closed-ended questions need to begin with an initial phrase that requires a short answer or a yesornoresponse. Examples of initial phrases that begin a closed-ended question are:</p>
											
							<p>“When…”<br />
								“Where…”<br />
								“Who…”<br />
								“Are you…”<br />
								“How much…”
								“Is it…”</p>
								
							<p>Notice that the answers to questions that begin with the phrases above can consist of a word or two. If you were to ask “How much credit debt do you have?”,the question could be answered by disclosing an amount –$5,000, for example. If you were to ask “Where do you work?”, the answer would be nothing more than the name of the employer or the location.</p>
												
					</fieldset> 

					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>EXERCISE: CLOSED-ENDED QUESTIONS</b></legend>
							<p>Read the client statements below and write either a closed-ended or an open-ended question in the space provided. Indicate whether it is closed-ended or open-ended.</p>
											
							<p>Sarah: This is the first time I’ve ever called a counselor but I’ve got to do something about this debt.</p>
							
							Counselor: <input type="text" name="" value="" />
							
							<p>Ray: Even though I’m unemployed now, I never seem to have enough time.</p>
							
							Counselor: <input type="text" name="" value="" />
							
							<p>Amy: I just got another billing statement from Big Chain Department Store and more late charges have been added.</p>
							
							Counselor: <input type="text" name="" value="" />
							
							<p>Al: My wife is the homemaker. I really don’t want her working outside the home. She has enough to do taking care of our two daughters.</p>
							
							Counselor: <input type="text" name="" value="" />
