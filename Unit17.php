						<legend><b>FICO SCORES</b></legend>
						
						<p>A credit score is a number lenders use to help them decide: If I give this person a loan or credit card, how likely is it that I will get paid back on time? A score is a snapshot of a person’s credit risk picture at a particular point in time.</p>
						
						<p>There are many types of credit scores but the most commonly used are credit bureau scores. Credit bureau scores are based solely on information gathered from consumer credit reports that are maintained at one of the credit-reporting agencies. The most widely used credit bureau score is based on a statistical model developed by Fair, Isaac. It is commonly known as a FICO score.</p>
						
						<p>Understanding credit scoring can help people manage their credit. A FICO score looks at the same information in a credit report that a lender will also use. By knowing how credit risk is evaluated, a consumer can take actions that will lower credit risk, and thus, raise the score over time.</p>

						<legend><b>Your Credit Report – The Basis of Your Score</b></legend>
						
						
						<p>Credit-reporting agencies process information on millions of borrowers. Lenders making credit decisions buy credit reports on their prospects, applicants, and customers from the credit-reporting agencies.</p>
						
						<p>Your report details credit history as it has been reported to the credit-reporting agency by lenders who have extended consumer credit. A credit report lists what types of credit are used, the length of time accounts have been opened, and whether or not bills have been paid on time. It tells lenders how much credit has been used and whether the consumer is seeking new sources of credit. It gives lenders a broader view of credit history than do other data sources, such as a bank’s own customer data.</p>
						
						<p>A credit report does not really exist until the consumer or a lender asks for it. It is then compiled by the credit-reporting agency based on the information stored in that agency’s files. This information is supplied by lenders, by court records and by the consumer.</p>
						
						<p>Tens of thousands of credit grantors — retailers, credit-card issuers, banks, finance companies, credit unions, etc. — send updates to each of the credit-reporting agencies, usually once a month. These updates include information about how their customers use and pay their accounts.</p>
						
						<p>A credit report reveals many aspects of borrowing activity. All pieces of information are considered in relationship to other pieces of information. The ability to quickly consider all this information is what makes credit scoring so useful.</p>
										
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>HOW SCORING WORKS</b></legend>
						
						<p>Along with the credit report, lenders can also buy a credit score based on the information in the report. That score is calculated by a mathematical equation that evaluates many types of information from the credit report at that agency. Exactly what formula is used to calculate a score is shrouded in mystery and protected by the Federal Trade Commission. By comparing this information to the patterns in hundreds of thousands of past credit reports, the score identifies a consumer’s level of credit risk.</p>
						
						<p>In order for a FICO score to be calculated from a credit report, the report must contain at least one account that has been opened for six months or more. In addition, the report must contain at least one account that has been updated in the past six months. This ensures that there is enough informationand enough recent informationin the report on which to base a score.</p>
						
						<p><b>More About FICO Scores</b><br />Credit bureau scores are often called FICO scoresbecause most credit bureau scores used in the United States and Canada are produced from software developed by Fair, Isaac and Company (FICO). FICO scores are provided to lenders by the three major credit-reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian and Trans Union.</p>
						
						<p>FICO scores have different names at each of the three credit-reporting agencies. All of these scores, however, are developed using the same methods by Fair Isaac, and Company and have been rigorously tested to ensure they provide the most accurate picture of credit risk possible using credit-reporting data. Fico score names for each credit bureau are listed below:</p>
						
						<table>
							<tbody>
								<th><b>Credit Reporting Agency</b></th>
								<th><b>FICO Score Name</b></th>
								<tr>
									<td>Experian Experian</td>
									<td>Fair, Isaac Risk Model</td>

						<p>At present, FICO scores provide the best guide to future risk based solely on credit report data. The higher the score, the lower the risk. No score, however, can predict whether a specific individual will be a goodor badcustomer.</p>
						
						<p>Also, while many lenders use FICO scores to help them make lending decisions, each lender has its own strategy, including the level of risk it finds acceptable for a given credit product. There is no singlecutoff scoreused by all lenders.</p>
										
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>More Than One Score</b></legend>
						
						
						In general, when people talk about your score, they are talking about your current FICO score. However, there is no one score used by lenders to make decisions about you. Here’s why:
						
						Credit bureau scores are not the only scores used. Many lenders use their own scores which may include the FICO score as well as other information about the consumer.
						
						FICO scores are not the only credit bureau scores. There are other credit bureau scores although FICO scores are by far the most commonly used. Other credit bureau scores may evaluate a credit report differently than FICO scores. In some cases, a higher score may mean more risk, not less risk as with FICO scores.
						
						An individual’s score may be different at each of the three main credit-reporting agencies. The FICO score from each credit reporting agency considers only the data in the credit report at that agency. If a person’s current scores from the credit-reporting agencies are different, it is probably because the information those agencies have on that person differs.
						
						An individual’s FICO score changes over time. As the data changes at the credit-reporting agency, so will any new score based on that credit report. A FICO score from a month ago is probably not the same score a lender would get from the credit-reporting agency today.					
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>WHAT A FICO SCORE CONSIDERS</b></legend>
						
						<p>There are 5 main categories of information that are used to calculate a FICO score. The categories have different levels of importance.</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li>Payment History: What is the track record?</li>
							<p>Approximately 35% of a score is based on this category.</p>
							
							<p>The first thing most lenders want to know is whether a consumer has paid past credit accounts on time. This is also one of the most important factors in a credit score.</p>
						
							<p>However, late payments are not an automatic score-killer. An overall good credit picture can outweigh one or two instances of late credit-card payments. By the same token, the absence of late payments in a credit report does not necessarily translate into a perfect score. Approximately 60 – 65% of credit reports show no late payments at all. Payment history is just one piece of information used in calculating the score.</p>
							
							<b>Payment history takes into account:</b>
							
							<p>Payment information on many types of accounts. These will include credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover), retail accounts (department store credit cards), and installment loans (loans where you make regular payments, such as car loans, finance company accounts and mortgage loans).</p>
							
							<p>Public record and collection items — reports of events such as bankruptcies, foreclosures, lawsuits, wage attachments, liens and judgments. These are considered quite serious, although older items and items with small amounts will count less than more recent items or those with larger amounts.</p>
							
							<p>Details on late or missed payments (delinquencies) and public record and collection items — specifically, how late they were, how much was owed, how recently they occurred and how many there are. A 60-day late payment is not as risky as a 90-day late payment, but recency and frequency count too. A 60-day late payment made just a month ago will count more than a 90-day late payment from five years ago. Note that closing an account on which there was a previously missed payment or satisfying a judgment or collection item does not make the late payment or item disappear from the credit report.</p>
							
							<p>How many accounts show no late payments. A good track record on most of your accounts will increase a credit score.</p>
							
							<li>Amounts owed: How much is too much?</li>
							<p>Approximately 30% of the score is based on this category.</p>
						
							<p>Having credit accounts and owing money on them does not mean a person is a high-risk borrower with a low score. However, owing a great deal of money on many accounts can indicate that a person is overextended and is more likely to make some payments late or to not pay at all. Part of the science of scoring is determining how much is too much for a given credit profile.</p>
						
							<b>Amounts owed takes into account:</b>
							
							<p>The amount owed on all accounts. Note that even if credit cards are paid in full every month, a credit report may show a balance on those cards. The total balance on the last credit card statement is generally the amount that will show on the credit report.</p>
							
							<p>Whether there is a balance on certain types of accounts. In some cases, having a very small balance without missing a payment shows a consumer has managed credit responsibly and may be slightly better than no balance at all. On the other had, closing unused credit accounts that show zero balances and that are in good standing will not generally raise a score.</p>
							
							<p>How many accounts have balances. A large number can indicate higher risk of over-extension.</p>
							
							<p>How much of the total credit line is being used on credit cards. Someone closer to maxing out on many credit cards may have trouble making payments in the future.</p>
							
							<p>How much of installment loan accounts is still owed compared with the original loan amounts. Paying down installment loans is a good sign that a consumer is able and willing to manage and repay debt.</p>
							
							<li>Length of Credit History: How established is an individual’s credit history?</li>
							
							<p>Approximately 15% of the score is based on this category.</p>
							
							<p>In general, a longer credit history will increase a score. However, even people who have not been using credit long may get high scores, depending on how the rest of the credit report looks.</p>
							
							<b>Length of credit history takes into account:</b>
							
							<p>How long the credit accounts have been established. The score considers both the age of the oldest account and an average age of all accounts.</p>
							
							<p>How long specific credit accounts have been established. Different accounts are evaluated in different ways.</p>
							
							<p>How long it has been since certain accounts were used. FICO scores consider not only how long an account has been opened but also whether or not it is active.</p>
							
							<li>New Credit: Is an individual taking on more debt?</li>
							<p>Approximately 10% of the score is based on this category.</p>
							
							<p>People tend to have more credit today and to shop for new credit more frequently than ever. Fair, Isaac and Company scores reflect this fact. However, research shows that opening several credit accounts in a short period of time represents a greater credit risk — especially for consumers who do not have a long credit history.</p>
							
							<b>New credit takes into account:</b>
							
							<p>Recent requests for new credit. Inquiries remain on a credit report for two years, although FICO scores only consider inquiries from the last 12 months. Note that if a credit report is ordered from a credit reporting agency or www.myfico.com, the score does not count this, as it is not an indication that a person is seeking new credit. Also, the score does not count requests a lender has made for a credit score in order to make someone a pre-approvedcredit offer, or to review an account, even though these inquiries may be seen on a credit report.</p>
							
							<li>Types of Credit in Use: Is it a healthy mix?</li>
							<p>Approximately 10% of the score is based on this category.</p>
							
							<p>The score will consider the mix of credit cards, retail accounts, installment loans, and finance company accounts. It is not necessary to have one of each, and it is not a good idea to open credit accounts just to have them in the mix. The credit mix usually will not be a key factor in determining a score, but it will be more important if a credit report does not have a log of other information on which to base a score.</p>
							
							<b>Types of credit in use takes into account:</b>
							
							<p>What kinds of credit accounts there are and how many of each. The score also looks at the total number of accounts. For different credit profiles, how many is too many will vary.</p>

						<legend><b>The Credit/Mortgage Connection</b></legend>
						
						<p>Mortgage lenders and brokers use FICO scores to determine mortgage rates. The FICO score will also determine how a client applies and qualifies for a mortgage. A FICO score is a three-digit number between 300 and 850 that tries to gauge a consumers creditworthiness.</p>
											
						<p>If a score is higher than 700, a client will not only qualify for the best loan terms, but lenders may also grant the loan without asking questions about income and assets. These loans are referred to as no-docsand are fast and easy to get.</p>
						
						<p>If a score is 660 or better, a client will get the best rates available from virtually all lenders. However, full documentation of income, assets, and current debt must be provided.</p>
						
						<p>If a score is between 620 and 660, a client may get a preferred-rate loan but will have fewer lenders to choose from. Lenders will look more closely at any transgressions on the credit report to determine whether they can push the client into the dreaded subprime market.</p>
						
						<p>If a score is less than 620, lenders will consider that client a subprime borrower. Subprime borrowers pay at least 1% more in interest on a home loan and may have to accept features like pre-payment penalties. ”What’s one percentage point?”,you might ask. Just one percentage point difference costs $23,410 for each $100,000 borrowed over thirty years!</p>

						<legend><b>RAISING THE FICO SCORE</b></legend>
						
						<p>It is important to note that raising a FICO score is a bit like getting in shape — it takes time and there is no quick fix. In fact, quick-fix efforts can backfire. The best advice is to manage credit responsibly over time.</p>
											
						<p>One general tip is to make sure the information in the credit report is correct. Check the credit report for accuracy at least 90 days before planning any major purchases such as applying for a mortgage. If errors are detected, have them corrected by the lender as well as any credit-reporting agency involved.</p>
											
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>Specific tips for raising a score include:</b></legend>
						
						<li>Pay bills on time. Delinquent payments and collections can have a major negative impact on a score.</li>
						
						<li>If there have been missed payments, get current and stay current. The longer a consumer pays bills on time, the better the score.</li>
						
						<li>Be aware that paying off a collection account will not remove it from the credit report. It will stay on the report for seven years.</li>
						
						<li>If an individual is having trouble making ends meet, encourage him/her to contact current creditors to negotiate an easier payment schedule. This will not improve the score immediately, but if credit begins to be managed with bills paid on time, the score will get better over time.</li>
						
						<li>Keep balances low on credit cards and other revolving credit. High outstanding debt can affect a score.</li>
						
						<li>Pay off debt rather than move it around. The most effective way to improve a score in this area is by paying down revolving credit.</li>
						 
						<li>Do not open a number of new credit cards just to increase available credit. This approach could backfire and actually lower the score.</li>
						
						<li>If the credit history is not long, do not open a lot of new accounts too rapidly. New accounts will lower the average account age, which will have a larger effect on the score when there isn’t a lot of other credit information. Also, rapid account buildup can be seen as risky business.</li>
						
						<li>FICO scores distinguish between a search for a single loan and a search for many new credit lines, in part by the length of time over which inquiries occur. Therefore, do rate shopping within a focused period of time.</li>
						
						<li>Note that it is OK to request and check one’s own credit report and one’s own FICO score. This will not affect a score as long as the credit report is ordered directly from the credit-reporting agency or through an organization authorized to provide credit reports to consumers.</li>
						
						<li>Apply for and open new credit accounts only as needed. Do not open accounts just to have a better credit mix — it probably will not raise a score.</li>
						
						<li>Have credit cards but manage them responsibly. In general, having credit cards and installment loans (and making payments on time) will raise a score.</li>
						
						<li>Note that closing an account that contains a balance does not make it go away. A closed account will still show up on a credit report and may still be considered by the score.</li>
								
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>Interpreting the Score</b></legend>

						<p>When a consumer or a lender receives a Fair, Isaac and Company credit bureau risk score, up to four score reason codesare also delivered. These explain the top reasons why the score was not higher. If the lender rejects a request for credit, and the FICO score was part of the reason, these score reasons can suggest why your score was not higher.</p>
											
						<p>These score reasons are more useful than the score itself in helping a consumer determine whether a credit report might contain errors and how the consumer might improve the score over time. However, if the score is already in the mid – 700s or higher, some of the reasons may not be very helpful, as they may be marginal factors related to the last three categories described previously (length of credit history, new credit, and types of credit in use).</p>					
					</fieldset>
					 
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>What Does NOT Go into a FICO Score?</b></legend>
						
						<li>Race, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status. U.S. law prohibits scoring from considering these facts, as well as information concerning public assistance or the exercise of any consumer right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.</li>
						
						<li> Age is not a consideration. Other types of scores may consider your age but FICO scores cannot under <b class="teal-text">the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.</b></li>    
						   
						<li>Salary, occupation, title, employer, date employed or employment history. Lenders may consider this information, however, as may other types of scores.</li>
						
						<li>Place of residence.</li>
						
						<li>Any interest rate being charged on a particular credit card or other account.</li>    
						
						<li> Any items reported as child/family support obligations or rental agreements.</li>
						    
						<li>Certain types of inquiries. The score does not count requests the consumer has made for his/her credit report. It also does not count promotional inquiries — requests made by lenders in order to offer pre-approved credit or administrative inquiries — requests made by lenders to review an account. Requests that are marked as coming from employers are not counted either.</li>    
						    
						<li>Any information not found in the credit report.</li> 
						
						<li>Any information that is not proven to be predictive of future credit performance.</li>
																	
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>FALLACIES AND FACTS</b></legend>
							
						<p>Fallacy: A poor score will haunt a person forever.</p>	
						
						<p>Fact: Just the opposite is true. A score is a snapshotof a person’s risk at a particular point in time. It changes as new information is added to bank and credit bureau files. Scores change gradually as a person changes the way he/ she handles credit. For example, past credit problems impact a score less as time passes. Lenders request a current score when a consumer applies for credit, so they have the most recent information available.</p>	
							
						<p>Fallacy: Credit scoring is unfair to minorities.</p>
							
						<p>Fact: <b class="teal-text">The Equal Credit Opportunity Act</b> prohibits lenders from considering race, nationality, gender or marital status. Independent research has monitored and continues to monitor the effectiveness of the ECOA .</p>
							
						<p>Fallacy: Credit scoring infringes on privacy.</p>
							
						<p>Fact: FICO scores evaluate a credit report alone which lenders already use to make credit decisions. A score is simply a numeric summary of that information. In fact, lenders using scoring can often ask for less information about a consumer. They may have fewer questions on the application form for example.</p>
							
						<p>Fallacy: A score will drop after applying for new credit.</p>
							
						<p>Fact: Probably not much. If several credit cards are applied for within a short period of time, multiple requests for credit report information (called inquiries) will appear on the report. Looking for new credit can equate with higher risk, but most credit scores are not affected by multiple inquiries from auto or mortgage lenders within a short period of time. The FICO score treats these as a single inquiry which will have less impact on the credit score.</p>
							
						<p>Fallacy: The score determines whether or not a consumer gets credit.</p>
											
						<p>Fact: Lenders use a number of facts to make credit decisions, including the FICO score. Lenders look at information such as the amount of debt a person can reasonably handle given his/her income, employment history, and credit history. Based on their perception of this information as well as their specific underwriting policies, lenders may extend credit although the score is low, or decline a request for credit although a score is high.</p>
