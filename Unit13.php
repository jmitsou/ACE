						<legend><b>HOW CREDIT WORKS</b></legend>
				        
                        <p>Using credit wisely begins by understanding the credit system. Credit is really all about credibility. Lenders extend credit to individuals they judge to be trustworthy. Any loan, whether it is a student loan, a mortgage or a revolving line of credit, is granted based on the expectation that it will be paid back to the lender. In return for the use of funds, consumers give lenders their promise that they will repay. Since trust is more valuable than a promise at transaction time, consumers pay the lender interest.</p>
											
				        <p>Just how much interest depends on the consumers track record. Has there been previous loans? Were payments made on time? What about income? How much debt does the consumer already have? Is the consumer stable? Does the consumer own a home?</p>
				        <p>Lenders try to find out as much as they can so they can determine a particular consumer’s risk factor. After all, there is a certain gambling element involved in extending credit and knowing the odds beforehand is a great advantage.</p>
							
				        <p>Over time, a system developed that serves to reduce the lenders risk that you will default on the loan. The basic conditions of a loan agreement are filled with incentives for on-time payments and penalties for late or missed payments. The most important incentive for making regular payments on time is the establishment of good credit. Lenders report consumer credit transactions and repayments to the three credit reporting agencies.</p>
							
				        <p>When a consumer establishes and maintains a good credit record, he/she becomes less of a risk in the eyes of the lender. Then, there are more options for getting new credit at better terms.</p>
							
				        <p>However, when borrowers do not fully understand the system and fail to play the credit game by the system’s rules, severe financial consequences can result. First and foremost is a damaged credit rating. Also, unresolved credit card debt doesn’t just go away. In fact, it is likely to grow beyond the consumer’s ability to manage it. This leads to bankruptcy. If and when the consumer tries to re-establish credit, he/she has to start all over with the lowest credit limits and the highest interest rates.</p>
				        <b>Credit Cards By The Numbers</b>
							
				        <p>Average credit card APR: 15.5%<br>
							Average APR for cash advances: 24%<br>
							Average late fee: between $25 to $35<br>
							Average number of cards per individual: 8<br>
							Percentage of card holders who carry balances from month to month: 46.7%</p>

						<legend><b>4 KEY PLAYERS</b></legend>
				        
                        <p><b>Consumers</b> need the leverage of credit to buy things that cost more than they are willing or able to purchase using their available cash. For example, the vast majority of the population needs the leverage of a mortgage to buy a home. People also use credit for the sake of convenience to make everyday purchases.</p>
											
				        <p><b>Merchants</b> welcome the use of credit because they know that consumers with credit tend to buy more. Credit card issuers charge retailers a nominal service charge for each transaction. Retail stores that offer merchant cards extend credit directly to the consumer.</p>
							
				        <p><b>Lenders</b>act as a bridge between the consumer and the products and services offered by merchants. They grant loans based on the projected profit they will make through the interest they charge. Lenders then borrow more funds from other lenders so they can continue to make more loans. Banks can borrow money directly from The Federal Reserve Bank.</p>
							
				        <p><b>The “Fed”</b> makes loans to banks so they can keep on lending. More consumer loans help to make a healthier economy. Banks themselves play the trust game. Will they repay on time? The only player who does not have to go through a credit check is the Federal Reserve Bank. When it needs more money, it can simply print more, raise taxes, or borrow it from you, the consumer, by selling bonds.</p>

						<legend><b>4 TYPES OF CREDIT</b></legend>
							
                        <p><b>Secured credit</b> is any loan backed by collateral. Mortgages and auto loans are examples of secured credit. In the event that the consumer defaults on the loan, the lender can seize the property that was pledged as collateral.</p>
											
				        <p><b>Unsecured credit</b> is not backed by collateral so the risk is much higher for the lender. If the consumer fails to repay, the lender must win a court judgement in order to recover any unpaid debt. It is granted solely on the consumer’s creditworthiness which includes credit history and current financial picture. Credit cards are the most prevalent examples of unsecured credit.</p>
                        
                        <p><b>Installment credit</b>can be either secured or unsecured. Consumers are granted a loan or credit, which must be repaid in equal installments over a specific time period. Common installment loans are automobile, student, and personal loans.</p>
                        
                        <p><b>Non-installment credit</b>is any loan repaid in one payment by a specified date. Any bill you receive that says, Payment due in full upon receipt of this bill, is non-installment credit. Examples include monthly utility and medical services.</p>

						<legend><b>4 TYPES OF CREDIT CARDS</b></legend>
				        
                        <p>Credit cards yield high dividends for their issuers, accounting for as much as 75% of the profits generated annually by banks. Many companies charge an annual fee for issuing a credit card, and most companies charge late fees, over-the-limit fees, and other miscellaneous charges. Lenders also profit by charging merchants and service providers a fee each time a customer uses the company’s credit card in the merchants establishment.</p>
											
				        <b>There are 4 major types of credit cards available to consumers:</b>
							
						<ol>
                            <li><b>Bank Cards</b> are issued by banks, savings and loans, and credit unions. Examples include Visa, MasterCard, and Discover. Bank cards may or may not come with an annual fee. Interest rates and terms vary considerably depending on the consumers credit rating and company policies.</li>
                            <li><b>Travel and Entertainment Cards</b>, despite their name, are not limited to travel and entertainment at all. Any consumer items and services may be obtained with these cards. Clients may be charged an annual fee and be required to pay the full balance each month. Lenders who issue these cards are less tolerant of late payments and quick to revoke privileges.</li>
                            
                            <li><b>Merchant Cards</b> are offered by most major department stores. Oil companies and airlines also issue merchant cards. These types of credit cards seldom charge annual fees and often provide discounts, frequent flyer miles, and other features.</li>
                            
                            <li><b>Secured Credit Cards</b> draw funds from money the consumer has deposited in a savings account. By borrowing his or her own money to make purchases, the consumer is able to exhibit good credit behavior by making regular payments to the account. This type of card is a good way to establish credit or repair a bad credit rating. Some cards come with a conversion feature so that after a period of regular payments, the consumer can upgrade to a regular credit card.</li>
                            
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p><b>Debit Cards</b><br>Debit Cards look like credit cards but they are not. Banks originally offered these types of cards called ATM cards expressly for withdrawing cash from an automated teller machine.</p>
                        
                        <p>Today, consumers habitually use debit cards to make deposits, account inquiries, and money transfers. They also use their debit cards to make everyday purchases. Essentially, they are electronic replacements for checks. When paying with a debit card, the amount of a store purchase is automatically (and immediately) deducted from a consumer’s checking account.</p>
												
					</fieldset> 
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>CREDIT LIMITS</b></legend>
						
						<p>Credit limits can vary considerably from a few hundred dollars to thousands. Some banks are quite lenient with credit. The more they lend, the more interest they can charge. Others are more conservative.</p>
						
						<p><b>The Far-Reaching Effects of Credit</b>
						How you manage credit is one of the most scrutinized aspects of your life. It not only affects your ability to get new credit but also affects your mortgage rate, your automobile insurance rate, and whether or not you are hired by an employer who does a background check. For example, you need to show a good credit history for jobs requiring that you handle money.</p>
											
						<p>Banks consider several factors when deciding how much credit the consumer will have access to. Most important is the consumer’s credit rating. Other factors include company policy, competition from other lenders, the availability of funds, and the economy. Clients need to be wary of receiving credit limits that go beyond their ability to pay.</p>
							
						<b>You may need a credit card to…</b>	
							
						<li>guarantee a hotel room</li>	
						<li>rent a car</li>
						<li>pay for emergency service away from home</li>
						<li>pay a doctor or dentist who requires immediate payment</li>
						<li>use as identification to cash a check</li>	
				
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>FINANCE CHARGES</b></legend>
						
						
						<p>Finance charges are based on the lender’s annual percentage rate (APR) which is the rate of interest charged on an annual basis. They can vary considerably from 8 to 21% or higher.</p>
						
						<p>The cost of credit is not only determined by the interest rate but also by how the interest is calculated. Because of this, consumers need to consider the lender’s balance computation method.</p>
										
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>BALANCE COMPUTATION METHODS</b></legend>
						
						<p><b>Average Daily Balance.</b>This is by far the most common computation method. It credits your account from the day payment is received by the issuer. To figure the balance due, the issuer totals the beginning balance for each day in the billing period and subtracts any credits made to your account that day. While new purchases may or may not be added to the balance, depending on your plan, cash advances typically are included. The resulting daily balances are added for the billing cycle. The total is then divided by the number of days in the billing period to get the average daily balance.</p>
											
						<p><b>Adjusted Balance.</b>This is the most advantageous method for card holders. Your balance is determined by subtracting payments or credits received during the current billing period from the balance at the end of the previous billing period. Also, purchases made during the billing period are not included.</p>
						
						<p><b>Previous Balance.</b>This is one of the least advantageous methods because finance charges are based on the amount owed at the end of the last billing cycle. It does not take in consideration any payments or new purchases you may have made.</p>
						
						<p><b>Two-Cycle Average Daily Balance.</b>For consumers who carry large balances from month-to-month, this is another method to be avoided. In this case, the average daily balance is derived from both the previous and the current billing cycles.</p>	
			
					</fieldset> 
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>HIDDEN FEES</b></legend>
											
						<p>Many fees besides interest contribute to the cost of credit. They are often hidden in the fine print. Sometimes referred to as nuisance fees, they include:</p>
							
						<p><b>Transaction Fees.</b> Unfortunately for credit card issuers, many cardholders keep credit-card payments current. They pay off their balance within the card’s grace period thereby avoiding finance charges. To compensate and increase revenue, many issuers impose transaction fees. Typically, transaction fees are 2 or 3% of the amount of a purchase. Transaction fees can add up quickly when cards are used frequently.</p>
						
						<p><b>Late Fees.</b> Late fees can be as high as $39 — more than triple the $11.96 average in May 1994 and it is now much easier for credit-card companies to charge late fees. Many creditors have decreased the amount of time between when the bill is mailed and when payment is due. It is also now common for late payments to trigger a substantial increase in the interest you pay.</p>
						
						<p><b>Over-The-Limit Fees.</b>Charges made beyond the credit limit do not always result in a credit card being rejected by the merchant. It could result in an added fee. Over-the-limit fees nearly tripled from $12.56 in 1994 to an average of between $29 to $35 until the CARD Act of 2009 put an end to these fees being an automatic feature of credit-card terms.</p>
						
						<p><b>Pay-Off Fees.</b>Sometimes a bank will actually penalize a cardholder for making all payments on time. In this case, finance charges cannot be added to the bill so a flat rate is included instead.</p>
						
						<p><b>Annual Fees.</b>Some credit-card issuers charge annual membership or participation fees. They often range from $25 to $50, sometimes up to $100; goldor platinumcards often charge between $75 and several hundred dollars.</p>
						
						<p><b>Charges for Cash Advances.</b>Many cardholders are unaware that the interest rate charged for cash advances can be substantially higher than the rate charged for purchases. Some of these rates are as high as 30% or more. Cash advances typically do not provide grace periods for avoiding that hefty finance charge.</p>
							 					
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>GRACE PERIODS</b></legend>
											
						<p>Some people confuse the idea of a grace period with the amount of time you have to pay your credit-card bill without incurring a late fee. Actually, a grace period is the time a consumer has before a credit-card issuer starts charging interest on new purchases. Stay within the grace period and it’s like getting an interest-free loan. However, the terms of credit are never quite that simple.</p>	
							
						<b>All grace periods are not created equal. Let’s take a look:</b>
						
						<p><b>Typical Grace Period.</b>This most common type of grace period uses the average daily balance including new purchases for applying interest. In this case, you pay interest on all new purchases unless you have paid your previous month’s balance in full.</p>
						
						<p><b>Full Grace Period.</b>Few cards have this most desirable feature. This type of grace period comes with cards that use the average daily balance excluding new purchases. Here, interest is not applied to new purchases whether or not your previous balance has been paid off.</p>
						
						<p><b>No Grace Period.</b> In this least desirable scenario, the average daily balance including new purchases is applied but whether or not you have paid off your previous balance doesn’t matter. You still pay interest.</p>
						
						<p>Which grace period is right for you? If you pay on time every time, either the typical or the full grace period will work for you. If you pay off your monthly balance only sometimes, then you will want the full grace period. No grace period is to be avoided.</p>
						
						<p>You can determine a card’s grace period by finding the balance computation method listed on the back of the statement. For no grace period cards, look for a statement indicating that you will pay a finance charge from the date of the transaction.</p>	
		
					</fieldset> 
										
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>CREDIT CARD TRENDS</b></legend>
						
						<p><b>Universal default.</b>This has been one of the most controversial trends in recent years. Based on the practice of risk-based pricing, a lender can change the terms of a credit agreement from the normal to the default terms. That often involves a substantial increase in the interest rate. How does it work? If your credit card has a universal default clause in it’s agreement, you can be late on one card one time and it will affect your interest rate on all your cards. Penalty rates are applied universally to all your accounts. In some cases, universal default can affect your auto insurance rates. The good news for consumers is that most forms of universal default have been prohibited by the CARD Act of 2009.</p>
						
						<p><b>Minimized payments.</b>Typical minimum payments at 2% of the balance often create a condition called negative amortization. This occurs when the monthly credit-card payment consistently falls short of covering all finance charges and fees assessed during the billing cycle and the outstanding balance continues to grow. Simply put, minimum payments don’t add up!</p>
						
						<p><b>Shrinking grace periods.</b>The average grace period in 1990 was 30 days. By 2006, it was 21 days, making it harder to enjoy interest-free credit-card purchases. With the CARD Act of 2009 (effective February 2010), standard credit cards cannot have a grace period less than 21 days.</p>
						
						
											
						<p><b class="teal-text">THE TRUTH IN LENDING ACT</b><br />
						This act requires that all credit-cared issuers disclose:</p>
						
						<li>The Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</li>	
						<li>The monthly finance charge (APR divided by 12)</li>
						<li>Whether the rate is fixed or variable. If it is variable, the lender must disclose how it is calculated</li>	 
						<li>The interest rate applied to cash advances</li>	
						<li>The duration of the grace period — the time in which a cardholder can pay off the balance without incurring interest</li>	 
						<li>By what method finance charges are calculated</li>	
						<li>Additional fees such as late payment fees, over-the-limit fees or cash advance fees</li>	 
						<li>Early interest posting dates. Purchases made on these cards are posted from the time of the transaction which translates into higher finance charges.</li>

						<legend><b>PREVENTING CREDIT CARD DEBT</b></legend>
						
						<p>It is clear that owning and using a credit card is a powerful and often expensive privilege for today’s consumer. It is easy to understand how someone can unwittingly accumulate debt in a relatively short amount of time.</p>
						
						<p>The ability to charge on impulse coupled with the fine print of credit agreements is a combination that can quickly create out-of-control debt. Here are some ways to avoid the pitfalls of credit-card use:</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li><b>Limit the number of credit cards you maintain.</b> Usually, there is no good reason to have more than one or two credit cards. In the case of a client with extensive debt problems, all credit accounts should be closed except the one with the lowest finance rate and balance.</li>
							
							<li><b>Do not maintain cards with the following feature: High interest rates.</b> If the only card a client plans to keep active has a high interest rate but the payments are up-to-date, he/she may request an interest rate reduction.</li>
							
							<li><b>Avoid credit cards with complicated billing policies.</b> If you cannot understand the language of the disclosure portion of a credit offer or the provisions listed on the credit contract, do not sign up.</li>
							
							<li><b>Minimum payments don’t add up.</b> Many consumers get locked into the idea that if they can make their minimum monthly payments, their credit debt will remain manageable. This simply is not true. If the consumer is making new purchases every month and only making the minimum payments, the debt will never go down. In fact, it will continue to grow. This, in turn, increases the finance charges which accrue based on the increasing balance. (See negative amortization above.)</li>
							
							<li><b>Limit the credit limit.</b> Banks and credit card issuers may increase your credit limit even when you have not requested it. Do not believe that this increase is a reward or that it somehow indicates your increased ability to pay for purchases. Basically, a high credit limit translates into higher monthly balances which, in turn, means higher interest payments.</li>
