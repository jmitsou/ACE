						<legend><b>GETTING YOUR CREDIT REPORT</b></legend>
						
						<p>Various changes in a consumer’s circumstances could signal the need for a current credit report. Career changes, promotions, or relocation should prompt a review of any information that an employer might view as derogatory. Some job applications request permission to do a credit check.</p>
							
						<p>Purchasing a new home or vehicle are times when a consumer will want to be sure there are no unpaid accounts or inaccurate information. Clients filing for separation or divorce would need to verify accountability on joint accounts and insure proper assignment of liability to outstanding loans and financial responsibilities.</p>

						<legend><b>THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT</b></legend>
							
						<p>Under <b class="teal-text">The Fair Credit Reporting Act</b>, anyone obtaining or reading a consumer’s credit report for reasons other than those listed here may face heavy fines or imprisonment:</p>	
							
							<li>Written permission for employment or other authorized reasons</li>
							<li>Application for government license</li>
							<li>Application for business license</li>
							<li>Credit or insurance transaction</li>
							<li>Court subpoena from a federal grand jury</li>
							<li>Requirement for setting child support</li>
							
						<p><b class="teal-text">The Fair Credit Reporting Act</b> also requires that negative reporting be erased 7 years from the date initiated. This includes a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy. A Chapter 7 Bankruptcy can remain on a credit report for up to 10 years.</p>
						
						<p>Within 60 days of denied credit, employment, insurance, or housing, a consumer may request a free copy of their report. Reports are issued free to consumers on welfare or if there is a reason to suspect fraud.</p>
											
						<p>It is highly advantageous for consumers to monitor their credit reports at least once a year.</p>
												
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>Ways to receive a copy of your credit report</b></legend>
							
						<ol>
							<li>If a consumer has been denied credit, employment, or insurance within the last 60 days, mail written proof of being turned down to the three credit-reporting agencies. It is important to get all three reports since the information contained on each will vary.</li>
								
							<li>Beginning in October 2005, all states are required to provide consumers one free copy of their credit report per year. You can request your credit report online by visiting each of the three credit bureau websites at:</li>

						<legend><b>READING A CREDIT REPORT</b></legend>
						
						<p>When consumers get their credit reports, they may be surprised about what information is included and what is left out. It is important to realize that a credit report is not a comprehensive picture of the consumer. There are two reasons for this:</p>
							
						<ol>
							<li>The three credit reporting agencies do not get their information from the same subscribers. Different creditors subscribe to different bureaus.</li>
							<li>Many creditors do not report consumer activity on a regular basis. In fact, some do not report information on consumer accounts unless the accounts are in default.</li>
						</ol>	

						<p>Some accounts are listed and some are not. To many consumers, credit reports may not seem fair. For example, mortgage companies and auto dealers sometimes do not report consistent on time payments. However, information will show up if the accounts are past due, in collections, or in legal proceedings.</p>
							
						<p><b>Below is a list of accounts regularly reported:</b></p>	 
							
							<li>Bankcards</li>	
							<li>Merchant cards from large chains</li>
							<li>Travel and entertainment cards</li>
							<li>Federal student loans</li>

						<p><b>The following list shows accounts not normally reflected in a credit report… unless they are in default:</b></p>
							
							<li>Utility bills</li>
							<li>Medical bills</li>
							<li>Mortgage or rent</li>
							<li>Automobile loans</li>
							<li>Merchant cards from small or local retailers</li>

						<p>As you can see, a consumer may be on time over a long period with mortgage and car payments and it will never be reflected by the credit bureaus. However, be one day late with a payment and it will show up on the report.</p>

						<legend><b>4 CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION</b></legend>
						
						<p>Deciphering a credit report is not as hard as cracking a secret enemy code, but it can seem like it. It is important to remember that, although the three credit reporting agencies use different formats, they all contain the following four categories of information:</p>
							
						<ol>
							<li>Personal identification information</li>
							<li>Account history information</li>
							<li>Public record information</li>
							<li>Inquiries</li>
						</ol>	

						<p>The order in which they are presented differ among the credit reporting agencies. A breakdown of the three formats appears below.</p>
							
							<b>TransUnion</b>
							<li>General Information</li>
							<li>Summary Line</li>
							<li>Public Records Information</li>

					</fieldset>
					 
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>INQUIRIES</b></legend>
							
						<p>Anytime a request is made to see a consumer’s credit report, it is reported as an inquiry on that consumer’s credit report. If a person applies for a lot of credit cards in a short time, it will produce a lot of inquiries on the report. When a consumer is denied credit because of too many inquiries, there is no legal recourse under existing legislation.</p>	
							
						<p>Consumers should not give their name and address to a merchant until they are ready to apply for credit there. Some merchants illegally run credit checks to get an idea as to what they can try to sell the consumer and how.</p>	
						
						<p>Too many inquiries on a credit report indicate that a person is “credit hungry.” Most inquiries are disregarded if they occurred six or more months ago. All credit inquiries should be removed from a report after two years.</p>	
							
						<p><b>2 Types of Inquiries</b><br />There are 2 types of inquires — hard and soft. <b>Hard inquiries</b> occur when the consumer applies for credit. <b>Soft inquiries</b> are those that come from companies that want to send out promotional information to a pre-qualified group or current creditors who are monitoring your accounts. Soft inquiries also occur when a consumer requests a copy of their credit report.</p>

						<p>Inquiries are what generate credit reports. There is a mistaken idea that credit reports are keep in enormous files and are constantly being updated as you go about your financial life. The reality is that credit reports do not exist until they are requested. Initiating an inquiry is what creates a credit report.</p>	
						
						<p>FICO scoring models (see Credit Scoring) ignore a vast majority of inquiries. For example, these models have buffer periods that ignore inquiries within 30 days of getting a mortgage or car loan. They also count two or more hard inquiries in the same 14-day period as just one.</p>
											
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>RESOLVING CREDIT REPORT ERRORS</b></legend>
							
						<p>It is up to nobody but the individual to make sure the information in his/her credit report is correct. Credit bureaus report what creditors tell them. They do not check for accuracy. Many experts acknowledge that up to 80% of all credit reports have some kind of misinformation.</p>
							
						<b>Common Credit Reporting Errors</b>
							
						<p>
							Information is mixed up with another report belonging to someone else with a similar or identical name.<br />
							The name of a former spouse appears on the report.<br />
							The name is misspelled, the address is wrong, or the Social Security number is incorrect.<br />
							Duplicate accounts show up.<br />
							Account information is inaccurate or incomplete. This includes incorrect account balances, showing closed accounts as opened, or paid-off accounts still showing as delinquent.<br />
							Outdated information is included. Negative account information must be removed after seven years. A Chapter 7 Bankruptcy must be removed after ten years.<br />
							Unauthorized inquiries are listed.<br />
							There is a failure to show that a tax lien has been released.
						</p>
							
						<b>Two things to keep in mind when fixing credit report errors:</b>	 
							
						<ol>
							<li>There is a standard procedure for getting rid of mistakes on a report under the terms of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.</li>
							<li>Erasing report errors by telephone or letter exchanges can take time. New online procedures can offer faster results.</li>
						</ol>	

						<b>Here’s what to do:</b>	
							
						<ol>
							<li>Complete the special investigation request form that will come with the report. Follow all the form’s instructions.</li>
							<li>Attach a letter to the completed form along with any documentation that helps prove the error. This includes copies of cancelled checks, receipts, account statements, as well as copies of previous correspondence between the consumer and the creditor involved.</li>
							
							<li>Maintain a copy of the completed investigation request form, letter, and all accompanying documentation. The date on the letter will signal when a response should come from the credit bureau. According to guidelines of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the credit bureau must respond within 30 days of receiving an investigation request form.</li>
							
							<li>Send the request by certified mail with a request for a return receipt. When you get the receipt, file it with the other documents. Below is a sample letter for correcting errors on a credit report. Be sure to attach a copy of the credit report to the letter. Have the specific errors highlighted.</li>
						</ol>	

						<b>Sample Letter for Disputing Errors on a Credit Report</b>	
						
						<p>
							Name of Agency<br />
							Attn: Customer Relations<br />
							RE: Your Name<br />
							Your ID#<br />
							Your Address<br />
							Your Telephone Number<br />
							Your Social Security Number<br />
							Your Date of Birth
						</p>
							
						<p>Please begin an investigation of the following items listed on my credit report that do not belong in my credit file.</p>	
							
						<p>Companys Name Account # Reason For Dispute<br />
							
							<input type="text" name="" value="" />
							<input type="text" name="" value="" />
							<input type="text" name="" value="" />
						</p>	
							
						<p>Please update my credit report and send me a copy at the conclusion of your investigation. Send the results to the organizations that have reviewed my credit report in the past six months and/or to employers that have reviewed it during the past two years. Thank you for your help and prompt attention to this matter.</p>

						<legend><b>Credit Report Mistakes are Common</b></legend>
						
						<p>According to a report issued in 2004 by The Public Interest Research Group, 1 in 4 reports contain errors serious enough to disqualify consumers from making major purchases. Over 75% of the reports from the study contained some kind of error. More than half of these errors involved personal information like misspelled names or outdated information.</p>
							
						<p>Individuals with common last names or suffixes (Smith, Jones, Brown, or Sr., Jr., II, III) often become confused with other people. Also, identity theft is on the rise. Individuals have been misrepresented or have had accounts opened in their name without their knowledge.</p>
																		
						<p>Should a client discover any disputable items, a claim may be filed with the credit reporting agency which supplied the report. The client will need to fill out the special investigation request form that is included with the credit report. According to <b class="teal-text">the Fair Credit Reporting Act</b>, the credit bureau is required to resolve the problem in a reasonable amount of time — generally 30 days. During that period of time, a Statement of Dispute will be added to the credit history. It is advisable for clients to request their report once a year to safeguard against errors that may damage their credit rating.</p>
											
					</fieldset>
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>What the Credit Bureaus Must Do</b></legend>
						
						<p>After completing their investigation, each credit bureau has 5 business days to send you written notice of its findings. It must delete or modify the contested information immediately if:</p>
							
						<ol>
							<li>the information being disputed has been determined to be inaccurate</li>
							<li>the information cannot be verified.</li>
						</ol>	
								
						<p>However, if the credit bureau later receives proof that the disputed information is accurate, it can reinsert the information into the report. Along with the credit bureau’s written notice of its findings, the consumer should also receive a revised copy of the credit report to verify that the requested changes have been made.</p>
							
						<p>After receiving the corrected report, wait a couple of months and then request another copy of the report. This is to make sure that the error does not reappear due to a glitch in the system.</p>
							
						<p>If a consumer disagrees with the credit bureau’s findings, he/she may insert a statement free of charge. The statement must be included every time the report is sent out. Send the letter by certified mail and keep the receipt and a copy of the report. As long as the charge is in dispute, the dispute will appear on the credit report.</p>
							
						<p><b>Your Rights Under <b class="teal-text">The Fair Credit Reporting Act</b></b><br />
						The credit bureau is required to resolve the problem in a reasonable amount of time — generally 30 days.</p>	
											
						<p>If a consumer feels that the credit bureau has not responded promptly and fairly to his/her situation, contact the State Attorney General or The Federal Trade Commission in Washington at (202) 326-2222.</p>
