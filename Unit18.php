						<legend><b>OBJECTIVES</b></legend>
						
						<li>To gain awareness about causes behind delinquent debt.</li>
						<li>To explore the psychological motivations behind spending.</li>
						<li>To gain awareness about the effects of indebtedness on clients.</li>
						
						<p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, credit-card debt has reached 1.4 trillion dollars. This debt drives nearly one and a half million consumers to file bankruptcy each year while a large percentage of the population struggles with monthly bills and expenses. Many are without adequate savings on which to fall back on should financial setbacks occur.</p> 
						
						<p>It is important for financial counselors to gain insight into why their clients are in debt in the first place. By helping clients identify the sources of their debt, counselors can help them pinpoint financial stumbling blocks and adjust their spending habits to a sound financial plan.</p>	
					
						<p>Understanding the dynamics behind spending and over-extending credit also serves to increase a sense of empathy for clients. As you will see, a very small percentage of debtors are “credit criminals.” The vast majority of consumers experiencing the stress of delinquent debt are well-intentioned individuals who have either suffered major financial setbacks or who have unwittingly gotten over their heads with bills.</p>

						<legend><b>SOURCES OF DEBT</b></legend>
						
						<p>Let’s look at some of the most prevalent reasons for indebtedness:</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li><b>Easy access to credit.</b> Credit card companies target nearly every sector of society with savvy credit offers that give the illusion of getting something for nothing. As a result, everyone seems to be carrying plastic — some with outrageous finance charges.</li>
							<li><b>Easy access to money.</b> ATMs and debit cards are everywhere you go and everywhere you spend money. If you have a PIN number, you can effortlessly withdraw whatever you need (and more) from your bank account. With easy cash and a debit card, you always spend more.</li>
							<li><b>Consumer culture.</b> Americans are increasingly becoming media-driven. Instead of comparing themselves to their neighbors, millions are tuning in to movies and television shows as their reference points of success and style. And those in the media are quite a bit harder to keep up with!</li>
							<li><b>Changing technology.</b> Our changing technology accounts for a significant increase in big ticket purchases that appear to be absolutely necessary in our fast-paced society. Many computer savvy people admit that in order to keep up with the advances in computer technology, consumers must purchase a whole new system every 18 months. New hi-tech features in cars, household appliances and wireless communication increase what consumers pay.</li>
							<li><b>Lack of financial literacy.</b> Many individuals in debt fail to evaluate credit offers properly, do not understand interest rates and finance charges adequately and are not pro-active in the management of their personal finances.</li>
							<li><b>Financial setbacks.</b> These include loss of income (job loss), medical emergency, death in the family or some unexpected cost. These setbacks are the facts of life that savings are supposed to help out with. However, many Americans no longer have the ability to save. Why? See above reasons.</li>
							<li><b>Spending too much.</b> According to VISA, who asked 50,000 consumers filing bankruptcy the cause of their indebtedness, as much as one-third cited overspending! Why do consumers spend more than they have? What are the psychological factors behind overspending?</li>
						</ol>

						<legend><b>THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SPENDING</b></legend>
						
						<p>Several books have been written which attempt to understand the motivations that ultimately drive people into debt and to identify various categories of spenders. By understanding the psychology behind debt, counselors, as well as the clients they serve, can predict negative outcomes and identify specific obstacles to financial well-being.</p>
						
						<p>Anselm Bassano (2001), writing for Legal and Trade Collectors Ltd., explains the benefit of understanding the causes of debt in terms of dollars and cents:</p> 
						
						<p>“Listening to each debtor and attempting to understand the state of mind can be an effective tool in securing payment. Indeed, when counselors pinpoint client motivation to spend, they are better able to help adjust that motivation to pay off debt and achieve control over their financial futures.”</p>
						
						<p>In her book, The Overspent American, Juliet Schor identifies several neurotic spending styles. Competitive spenders aggressively try to establish and maintain status by keeping up with their particular reference group. As mentioned in the primary reasons of indebtedness, the reference group of choice no longer lives in your neighborhood. They live in the media where style and success are defined. The problem is, for most Americans, the level of opulence portrayed in the media is simply unattainable.</p>
						
						<p>Other spending styles are described in the books, Emotional Business by David Krueger and Consuming Passions by Ellen Mohr-Catalano and Nina Sonenberg. They include:</p>
						
						<p><b>Compulsive spending</b> is the attempt to alleviate a sense of emptiness by binge shopping and frivolous spending.</p>
						
						<p><b>Co-dependent spending</b> tries to create dependency in others by showering them with perceived necessities.</p>
						
						<p><b>Narcissistic spending</b> is an attempt to overcome feelings of inner inferiority by spending to look good. This could include designer clothing, hair and skin treatments, and products that signify status like expensive watches and jewelry.</p>
						
						<p><b>Revenge spending</b> usually occurs in relationships where one person exacts punishment on another by spending their money. They literally get themin the pocket.</p>
						
						<p>The problem with categorizing people as neurotic spenders is that this serves to pathologize consumers as somehow mentally unstable or ill. It is not the goal of the counselor to categorize spenders. Rather, it is important to explore the various psychological motivations behind overspending in order to recognize them as patterns of behavior all people exhibit from time to time.</p>
						
						<p>Some reasons behind overspending are based on erroneous beliefs. For example, many over-spenders rationalize their spending by thinking that their income will increase. This is the assumption that advertisers prey upon when they announce no payments until next yearor better yet, next millennium. By then, many believe, they will have accumulated savings, received an inheritance, or won the lottery.</p>
						
						<p>Other beliefs are products of our childhood and the messages we received about money as we were growing up. Some of us were told that money is the root of all evil. We heard fairy tales about misers who horded their riches only to meet a tragic end, pirates who sank to the bottom of the sea weighed down by treasure, and evil queens adorned in gold. These stories and images help to shape our relationship with money. Do we fear it? Do we embrace it? Do we need to spend it in order to realize its power? Or do we understand that its real power is in creating financial freedom?</p>

						<legend><b>PREDATORY LENDING</b></legend>
						
						<p>The sources of excessive debt include the current lending climate and trends in borrowing and extending credit. Predatory lenders do just what the name implies. They exploit borrowers, especially vulnerable groups such as the elderly, minorities and people with poor credit histories by charging high interest rates and excessive fees. Many of these types of lenders use deceptive sales practices to trick people into getting loans they cannot afford to repay. The results can lead to foreclosure, eviction and homelessness.</p>
						
						<p>Predatory lending has become a growing problem nationwide. For this reason, federal and state governments have responded with increased regulatory enforcement and educational outreach efforts. One example is a campaign by Freddie Mac called”Don’t Borrow Trouble.” Federal Reserve Banks have also become actively involved with this issue.</p>
						
						<p>There is no one precise definition of predatory lending. Rather, it consists of a number of practices that unfairly exploit consumers. Predatory lending includes both technically legal but high-cost loans and outright fraud through deceptive sales practices.</p>
						
						<p>A common element of all predatory loans is exploiting a consumer’s ability (or inability) to repay. Borrowers are often lent amounts far in excess of what their incomes can support. In the case of mortgage loans, lenders are assured of a profit either through loan repayments or foreclosure. Another characteristic is interest rates and fees that are well in excess of what is required to compensate for risk and to earn a reasonable profit.</p>
						
						<p>Predatory lenders often justify their high interest rates and fees by citing the additional risk posed by borrowers. In reality, most predatory loans are low risk because they are secured by the borrower’s home, automobile, or other property. Therefore, there is no need for the substantial risk premium.</p>
						
						<p>Traditional loans from banks and credit unions often charge loan rates according to risk (e.g. higher rates for unsecured loans). With predatory loans, there is little or no relationship between cost of credit and the risk assumed by the lender. All borrowers pay high rates and fees.</p>
											
					</fieldset> 
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>CHARACTERISTICS OF PREDATORY LOANS</b></legend>
						
						<p><b>Frequent Refinancing.</b> Making multiple loans to the same customer is a great way for predatory lenders to maximize their profits. They typically encourage borrowers to refinance an existing loan into a bigger, longer-term loan — often at a higher interest rate. This practice is called loan flipping.</p>
						
						<p><b>Ability to Repay is Disregarded.</b> Consumers are encouraged to borrow more than they can afford. Predatory lenders do not care if the borrowers cannot keep up with the monthly payments. Borrowers can always refinance. Or predatory lenders can simply start the foreclosure process.</p>
						
						<p><b>Payment History is NOT Reported.</b> Predatory lenders generally do not report the borrowers payment history to the credit bureaus. So even if the borrower is able to keep the loan current, it is not reflected in the credit report or the borrowers credit score.</p>
						
						<p><b>Balloon Mortgages.</b> A balloon mortgage is a loan in which the borrower makes small monthly payments for five to seven years after which the loan becomes due and must be paid off in one large final payment. This practice pretty much guarantees that the borrower will refinance.</p>
						
						<p><b>Exorbitant Fees.</b> Fees are usually much higher than those charged by reputable banks and credit unions.</p>
								
					</fieldset>
					
					 <fieldset id="space">
					 	<legend><b></b></legend>
					 	
					 	<p><b>LOANS TO WATCH OUT FOR</b> — also known as cash advance loans or post-dated check loans — issue short-term, single payment loans aimed at low-and middle-income workers who live paycheck to paycheck.</p>
					 	
					 	<p><b>Car Title Loans</b> usually require no credit check and few questions are asked. However, the borrower must use his or her car as collateral.</p>
					 	
					 	<p><b>Tax Refund Anticipation Loans,</b>also known as rapid refunds, appeal to people who are short on cash and expect an income tax refund. Typically, a high interest rate is charged for a relatively short amount of time.</p>

						<legend><b>GAMBLING AND ADDICTIONS</b></legend>
						
						<p>You dont have to go to Las Vegas. Gambling is everywhere today. Once confined to backrooms and pool halls, gambling has become mainstream. Over 80% of Americans have gambled at least once. Gambling is legal in 48 states.</p>
						
						<p>Besides casino gambling, there are now state lotteries, cruise ship and riverboat gambling, scratch card games, slot machines, keno, sports wagering, horse and dog race gambling and poker games targeting teenagers. Gambling now seems to cater to the entire family. Some of our Congressmen even want to tie in voter registration with playing the lottery!</p>
						
						<p>Gambling really produces no winners. Can anyone declare that they are a successful gambler or that they make their living by gambling? Gambling makes the casino owners rich, not the gamblers. Gambling is more likely going to ruin relationships and destroy family resources. In fact, the very concept of money is hijacked through gambling. No longer is money viewed as a tool for realizing financial goals. Instead it becomes the means by which the gambler stays in the action.</p>
						
						<p>According to a study conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health, 4.2 million Americans are addicted to gambling. Sixty percent of them have annual incomes of less than $25,000.</p>
						
						
						<p>If you or someone you know has a gambling problem:</p>
						
						<p>You can learn more by visiting the website of the National Council on Problem Gambling at www.ncpgambling.org or by calling them at (800) 522-4700.</p>
						
						<p>The National Council on Problem Gambling states:</p>
						
						<p>Although no substance is ingested, the problem gambler gets the same effect from gambling that someone else might get from taking a tranquilizer or having a drink. The gambling affects the persons mood and the gambler keeps repeating the behavior attempting to achieve the same effect. But, just as tolerance develops to drugs and alcohol, the gambler finds that more and more of the gambling experience is needed to achieve the same emotional effect as before and creates an increased craving for the activity and the gambler finds they have less and less resistance as the craving grows in intensity and frequency.</p>
						
						<p>Problem gamblers like substance abusers may require intervention and treatment in order to control compulsive and destructive behaviors. Although financial difficulties most frequently drive gamblers to seek counseling, the problem goes beyond personal finances.</p>
						
						<p>Unless the gambler recognizes the source of the problem and has successfully abstained from all gambling activities for at least 30 days, focusing on finances is premature. Active problem gamblers need to confront their behaviors first! This most frequently involves therapy which is beyond the scope and expertise of the financial counselor.</p>
						
						 <b>Signs of problem gambling include:</b>
						
						 <ul>
							<li>Increased frequency of gambling activity and money spent.</li>
							<li>Neglecting family and job due to gambling.</li>
							<li>Preoccupation with gambling.</li>
							<li>Deriving intense pleasure and excitement from gambling.</li>
							<li>Gambling continues regardless of negative effects.</li>
							<li>Gambling is used as a way to escape anxiety and stress. After a loss, or series of losses, taking greater risks.</li>
							<li>Borrowing money to continue gambling.</li>
							<li>Moods are tied to winning or loosing.</li>
							<li>Hiding gambling activities and evidence.</li>
						 </ul>

						<legend><b>SELF-ASSESSMENT: ARE YOU A PROBLEM GAMBLER?</b></legend>
						
						<p>The following 20 questions may help determine if someone has a compulsive gambling addiction.</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li>Do you lose time from work due to gambling?</li>
							<li>Is gambling having a negative effect on your home life?</li>
							<li>Is gambling affecting your reputation?</li>
							<li>Have you ever felt remorse after gambling?</li>
							<li>Do you ever gamble to get money to pay debts or solve financial difficulties?</li>
							<li>Does gambling negatively affect your productivity or ambition?</li>
							<li>After losing, do you feel an urge to get back in the action?</li>
							<li>After winning, do you feel an urge to try and win more?</li>
							<li>Do you ever gamble until your last dollar is gone?</li>
							<li>Have you ever borrowed to pay for your gambling?</li>
							<li>Have you ever sold anything to finance gambling?</li>
							<li>Do you keep a gambling fund separate from other money?</li>
							<li>Does gambling make you careless with respects to the welfare of you or your family?</li>
							<li>Do you ever gamble longer than you had planned?</li>
							<li>Do you ever gamble to escape worry or trouble?</li>
							<li>Have you ever committed or contemplated an illegal act to finance gambling?</li>
							<li>Does gambling interfere with your sleeping?</li>
							<li>Is gambling fueled by arguments, disappointments or frustrations?</li>
							<li>Do you have an urge to gamble as a way to celebrate?</li>
							<li>Have you ever considered suicide as a result of gambling?</li>

						<legend><b>THE CONDITION OF INDEBTEDNESS</b></legend>

						<p>Being in debt has its own effects which often serve to exacerbate the situation. Patterns appear and reappear as debtors repeat past mistakes. Perhaps one of the best research-based appraisals of the various types of delinquent debtors is from Kevin Keleghan. As Chief Credit Officer for Sears Credit, he conducted 200 structured interviews with customers who had delinquent accounts.</p>
						
						<p>What he came up with are 6 types of debtors:</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li><b>The Imprudent.</b> These are consumers who have no money put away for a rainy day. Generally, they live one day at a time without any financial goals. Setbacks such as interruption of income, medical emergency, health problems, or marital breakup can knock down their lifestyle, assets, and credit as if they were bowling pins.</li>
							<li><b>The Naive.</b> Many consumers today do not know the consequences of unpaid debt. Some think that if they just ignore their debt, it will eventually go away. What usually goes away, however, is any chance for financial freedom.</li>
							<li><b>Fortune’s Victim.</b> Yes, some people in debt have done everything right. They planned, they saved, they practiced responsible spending and lending. And yet, they suffer financial collapse due to some catastrophic life event. Its not fair, but indebtedness can and often does happen to conscientious, money-savvy people.</li>
							<li><b>The Reckless Spender.</b> These are people who, for whatever emotional reason, spend more than they have. They may impulse buy, cave in to salespeople, spend money on friends due to a need to be liked or have deep feelings of entitlement — the “I deserve it” syndrome.</li>
							<li><b>The Unethical.</b> These are the fraudsters who borrow on credit with absolutely no intention of paying back their loans.</li>
							<li><b>The Impoverished.</b> Some high-risk consumers are issued credit cards by accident. Once they have it, they use it to make necessary purchases like food and clothing now with the added cost of finance charges.</li>
						
						</ol>
												
						<p>Keleghan suggests that for each of these types of debtors, different methods are needed in helping settle their accounts. His study is based on the premise that a debtor’s history can be used as a predictor of what will ultimately motivate the debtor to pay down delinquent debt.</p>
						
						<p>For example, a client who appears to be fortune’s victim may already possess a strong commitment toward the resolution of debt whereas the unethical debtor will have none. The imprudent and naïve debtors could use some help with being pro-active with their financial goals and learning more about lender policies. The reckless spender may need some quality time working out a disciplined budget and finding new ways to relieve stress.</p>
						
						<p>The condition of being in debt feels different for different types of people. Many young people in debt express dismay and fear. They sincerely dont know how the amounts on their billing statements got so high. Often, they are the most susceptible to harassing calls from collectors because they lack knowledge of their consumer rights.</p>
						
						<p>Older debtors, on the other hand, may take their debt more personally or as a sign of weakness. They may express embarrassment or humiliation. Outstanding debt can cause stress and distress in every aspect of an individual’s life — self-esteem, relationships, parenting, job performance and health.</p>

						<legend><b>The Fine Art of Tea</b></legend>
							
						<p>A visitor to Japan described his experience while visiting a famous te ahouse where the service of a cup of tea has been established as a fine art. While looking over the menu, he became puzzled why the price of a certain cup of tea was the equivalent of one U.S. dollar while another cup of tea on the menu costs $100. He asked the elderly proprietor for an explanation for the difference in price. The old man said, The difference is that the cup that costs one dollar costs one dollar and the cup that costs $100 costs $100.With that, he bowed slightly and walked away.</p>
											
						<p>This is an example of buying a product or service vs. buying a spending experience. Many people go clothes shopping to make themselves feel better. They bring the clothes home, hang them up in the wardrobe and never wear them. They are consumers of the experience only. The product itself is not important. Does the $100 tea taste better? Not really. But the $100 tea gives he who selected it a special feeling that the dollar tea can’t. It’s a pure spender’s high.</p>

						<legend><b>DEALING WITH DEBT: THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE WORST</b></legend>
						
						<p>Anselm Bassano identified 4 types of debtors in terms of how they handle their debt:</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li><b>Panickers</b> fail to prioritize their debts properly and regularly borrow more to pay off existing debts.</li>
							
							<li><b>Mourners</b> initially maintain a state of denial about their debts. Finally, when the situation sinks in, they get angry and blame creditors for their problems.</li>
							
							<li>Rationalists do it the right way. They rank order their debts according to importance and negotiate payment plans based on available resources.</li>
							
							<li><b>Fraudsters</b> set out to abuse the system with no intention of ever paying back what was extended to them.</li>
						</ol>
						
						<p>As a counselor, you will come in contact with all these types and more. It is your job to listen to them, assess their circumstance, and to also appraise their emotions concerning their debt. Some clients may chuckle over their debt while others suffer from severe stress and anxiety. Clearly, different approaches are necessary in working to motivate and empower individuals who come from all walks of life and exhibit a wide variety of attitudes about money and debt.</p>
									
					</fieldset> 
					
					<fieldset id="space">
						<legend><b>SUMMARY</b></legend>
						
						<ol>
							<li>It is important for counselors to gain an understanding of the sources of debt for two reasons:</li>
								<p>a. it helps to increase counselor empathy toward clients in debt.<br />
								b. it helps clients and counselors identify past financial stumbling blocks.</p>
							<li>Prevalent reasons for indebtedness include easy access to credit and a lack of financial literacy among consumers.</li>
							<li>Many consumers overspend due to unhealthy spending styles which include compulsive spending, co-dependent spending and revenge spending.</li>
							<li>Consumer spending patterns may result from erroneous beliefs, attitudes and expectations about money.</li>
							<li>Predatory lending is a growing trend in today’s consumer culture; it is yet another source of problematic debt.</li>
							<li>Indebtedness is a condition that affects different people in different ways.</li>
